## Spatialists blog

This is a Quarto-based microblog about geospatial news. Posts live in `posts/` as `.qmd` files, organized by `posts/YEAR/MONTH/DD-slug/index.qmd`.

## Footnotes

`footnotes.md` at the repo root is a manually curated glossary of reusable footnote definitions. When helping write or review a `.qmd` post:

1. Read `footnotes.md` and check if any terms, abbreviations, or concepts in the draft have a matching entry.
2. Suggest inserting matching footnotes where appropriate — don't add footnotes the author hasn't used before without asking.
3. Use **reference-style footnotes** as the default format: `[^label]` in the text body and `[^label]: definition` at the end of the post.
4. When a matching entry exists in `footnotes.md`, reuse its definition verbatim (the author has already curated the wording).
