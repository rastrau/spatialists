Sometimes as a geospatial professional you want to find OGC and 
other^[Tile services, Esri services] geoservices endpoints being displayed in a 
web map. The "traditional" approach involves using your preferred browser's 
developer tools to inspect the resources requested through network traffic. 

With a new extension this task becomes a lot easier: When the 
[Chromium-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) 
[Geo Hound extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/geo-hound/nooldeimgcodenhncjkjagbmppdinhfe) 
is enabled, it automatically detects geoservices (and geospatial files such as 
KML/KMZ, GeoJSON, Shapefiles, and GeoTIFFs) on any webpage you visit. It then 
collects these in a convenient list for later use:

> With Geo Hound, you can:
> 
> - Save detected services with automatic deduplication
> - Test web compatibility with one-click CORS^[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing] validation  
> - Normalize URLs for use in ArcGIS, QGIS, and other GIS applications
> - Organize services with custom folders and notes
> - Search and filter your collected services and files
> - Disable detection on selected URLs or domains
> - Export service information for team sharing
> - Track service analytics with cloud database integration 

A quick test shows that the extension works on, for example,
[map.geo.bs.ch](https://map.geo.bs.ch), [geo.so.ch/map](https://geo.so.ch/map),
[maps.zh.ch](https://maps.zh.ch/), [geo.zh.ch/maps](https://geo.zh.ch/maps), 
[zugmap.ch](https://zugmap.ch/), and 
[map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch), not, however, on 
[map.geo.tg.ch](https://map.geo.tg.ch).
