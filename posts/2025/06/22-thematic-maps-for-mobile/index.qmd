Thematic maps are especially difficult to do well on mobile: Just for one, 
small entities are hard to see in traditional cartographic layouts. 
[Jonas Oesch](https://www.jonasoesch.ch) who works for the Zurich-based 
newspaper "NZZ" has [written a summary blog post of research that looked into 
this problem for thematic _world_ maps](https://www.jonasoesch.ch/articles/thematic-worldmaps-on-mobile/): 

> Most world maps you see online are not really designed for mobile screens. 
They're too small and require interaction to see countries like Switzerland. 
At NZZ, we wondered if we could come up with a design that works better. 

In order to rethink thematic world maps, the team has identified the most 
typical types of maps they use: A) "Glorified Lists" and B) "Spatial 
Distribution Maps". They came up with two new solutions:

> In a large user study, we showed that our redesigned world map improves 
readability â€“ especially for small countries. We also found that using bubbles 
sized according to population, rather than land area, led to interpretations 
that more accurately reflected the underlying data.

So both map types performed their function better than the baseline. But 
despite the improved functionality, the second map type proved not very popular: 

> Still, many readers commented that the bubble map was hard to read. A few 
added that it was more informative, but overall, the map remains unpopular. 
We've received similar feedback internally, even when the reasoning behind the 
design is explained.

A tough, but maybe not uncommon, problem of conveying spatial information.
