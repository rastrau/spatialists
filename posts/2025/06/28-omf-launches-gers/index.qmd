description: "The #Overture Maps Foundation (#OMF) is launching its Global 
Entity Reference System #GERS, assigning unique IDs to billions of geospatial 
features. Users can use GERS IDs to reference OMF features in their own data 
and bridge files to connect to the data sources used for OMF's data."

The [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/) (OMF) announces the 
launch of its [Global Entity Reference System](https://overturemaps.org/gers/) 
(GERS). The addition of GERS IDs to features in OMF's datasets is meant to make 
data integration and augmentation (where additional data is added or joined to 
geospatial entities) easier:

> GERS IDs are a defining characteristic of Overtureâ€™s open map datasets. 
> Each "entity" in the base maps carries a unique ID, including 2.6 billion 
> buildings, 64 million places, nearly 447 million addresses, and 321 million 
> road segments. (...) By incorporating GERS IDs into any data that needs to 
> be associated with those base layers, users can easily combine relevant data 
> to build richer applications.

There are several articles that may be interesting with respect to this: 

- the 
[article with the announcement](https://overturemaps.org/announcements/2025/overture-maps-launches-gers-a-global-standard-for-interoperable-geospatial-ids-to-drive-data-interoperability/), 
- an [article explaining the GER system](https://overturemaps.org/blog/2025/understanding-overtures-global-entity-reference-system/), and 
- an [article explaining "bridge files"](https://overturemaps.org/blog/2025/introducing-bridge-files/) 
that allow linking OMF input datasets^[such as OpenStreetMap, Esri, Microsoft 
and other data] to the resulting data through GERS.
