[Cadence Maps](https://cadencemaps.infs.ch/) is a new cloud-native data service 
(currently in the prototype stage) for distributing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in 
the Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Liechtenstein[^dachli] region as GeoParquet 
files using a unified schema (following the pattern of the Overture Maps 
Foundation (OMF)). The goal of Cadence[^cadence] Maps is to make OSM data more readily 
available for analysis. The platform is the product of a Bachelor's thesis at 
the [University of Applied Sciences Eastern Switzerland](https://www.ost.ch/en/) 
(OST).

Currently, [Cadence Maps](https://cadencemaps.infs.ch/) offers OSM data on 
administrative boundaries and POIs^[Points-of-interest], "compatible with 
Overture Maps"[^compatible] and accessible via a static web interface from S3 
object storage. The data can be queried directly using tools such as DuckDB and 
SQL or Python. The production pipeline and backend of Cadence Maps relies on 
open-source tooling.

Future plans include refining taxonomy and data issues, benchmarking, and 
turning the prototype into a weekly updated offering.

There is a longer [introductory article by Stefan Keller](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cadence-maps-cloud-native-osm-geoparquet-data-service-stefan-keller-6kmje/?trackingId=ssAjiWEge%2FpWcnE%2F6li9Iw%3D%3D) with some interesting points also 
regarding OMF data. An in-depth description of perceived shortcomings of OMF 
and a comparison of OMF and Cadence Maps data could be interesting.

[^dachli]: Colloquially, this region can be called "D-A-CH-LI" in German (as 
does the [original post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cadence-maps-cloud-native-osm-geoparquet-data-service-stefan-keller-6kmje/?trackingId=ssAjiWEge%2FpWcnE%2F6li9Iw%3D%3D)) â€“ as a contraction of the 
countries' abbreviations.
[^compatible]: From what I have read, it didn't become quite clear to me, if 
*"compatible"*&#32;refers to the data categories or, more deeply, to the schema / 
data model. And I haven't yet had time to investigate the data.
[^cadence]: According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence), "in 
Western musical theory, a cadence is the end of a phrase in which the melody or 
harmony creates a sense of full or partial resolution, especially in music of 
the 16th century onwards."
