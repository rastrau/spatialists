The [SOGI-OSIG[^sogi] GIS Technology Specialist Group](https://www.sogi.ch/en/organization/specialist-groups) has updated their interactive GIS Trend 
Radar[^german] at [gistrends.ch](https://gistrends.ch) to version 2.0. The 
radar classifies technologies, paradigms, and concepts into three rings:

- Established (29 entries)
- Emerging (6 entries)
- Descending (5 entries)

In order to decide on the classification of a technology or concept, the GIS 
Trend Radar analyzes four criteria (auto-translated from SOGI-OSIG): 

- Market penetration: This criterion describes the extent to which a technology 
is already established on the market. Market penetration therefore describes 
the sale of existing products on a market. It shows whether a technology is 
used by companies, organizations and governments and how widespread it has 
become.
- Technological maturity: This criterion assesses how mature a technology is 
and how close it is to being fully functional. It looks at the level of 
development, reliability and stability.
- Businesses and economic viability: This criterion looks at the extent to 
which a technology is sustainable and economical from a business perspective 
and whether it is worth replacing an existing solution with it. The aim is to 
assess the economic opportunities and risks for companies.
- Users and ecosystem: This criterion examines how well a technology is 
accepted by the target group and whether it offers a supporting ecosystem. The 
aim is to analyze the benefits for users and the availability of know-how and 
resources.

The rating of each trend radar entry with respect to this criteria can be found 
in a separate table.
