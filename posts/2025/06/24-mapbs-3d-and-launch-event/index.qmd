In its [latest newsletter edition](https://mailchi.mp/bs.ch/lunchlearn_3d), the canton of Basel-City announces the successful conclusion of the "3D Geoportal" project. The most notable outcome of the project is [MapBS 3D](https://3d.geo.bs.ch/).

Besides 3D content such as buildings (including those in Germany, France, and Basel-Landschaft), planned and approved construction projects, bridges, vegetation, oblique aerial imagery and embedded historical images, [MapBS 3D](https://3d.geo.bs.ch/) also features various analytical functions: measuring heights, distances, and areas, shadow simulation, and visibility or viewshed analysis.
