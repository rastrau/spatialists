February marked the 25 year anniversary of the 
[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) 
(SRTM) which gave us the then revolutionary global^[well, due to the inclined orbit 
of course not *truly* global] high resolution^[dozens of meters] elevation dataset 
of the same name. What an achievement!

SRTM travelled on board of Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS^[Space Transportation 
System]-99 mission in February 2000. Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric 
C-band SAR^[Synthetic Aperture Radar] system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 
60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle's transport bay. During 
data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording 
tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 
days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth 
surface. 

Initially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over 
the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember 
from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters 
and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator^[the resolution is higher towards the 
poles]. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 
1-arcsecond resolution.

To celebrate the occasion, there is an 
[interesting look back on SRTM by NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/history/25-years-ago-sts-99-the-shuttle-radar-topography-mission/) 
as well as [one by the DLR](https://www.dlr.de/en/latest/news/2025/how-a-space-shuttle-mission-revolutionised-earth-observation)
