The commodification of high-resolution optical satellite imagery continues. In 
the domain of [small satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_satellite),
ONGLAISAT of the Tokyo-based company [ArkEdge Space](https://arkedgespace.com) 
developed in collaboration with the 
[Taiwan Space Agency TASA](https://www.tasa.org.tw) has achieved a spatial 
resolution of approximately 2.5 meters from a relatively low orbit of 410 
kilometers.

From the [press release](https://arkedgespace.com/en/news/2025-02-07_onglaisat): 

> The results of this demonstration—including world-class ground resolution, 
enhanced image clarity through TDI^[[Time delay integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_delay_and_integration), a forward-motion compensation technique], and 
efficient data compression via onboard processing—as well as the advanced 
satellite technology required to achieve them can be applied not only to 6U 
class CubeSats but also to larger spacecraft in future missions.

While the sample image displayed [here](https://www.theverge.com/news/608297/arkedge-space-tasa-6u-onglaisat-earth-images-validation) may also show some of 
the current limitations of TDI, it's nevertheless an exciting development to 
potentially have this spatial resolution available from small space-borne 
platforms.
