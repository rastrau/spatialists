As [announced a few weeks ago](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/05-12-gdal-3-11-released-with-new-gdal-program/), on June 3rd, the GDAL Project Steering Committee (PSC) hosted a webinar on the modernization of GDAL CLI^[Command-line interface] , which was initiated with the release of version 3.11 on May 13th. At the center of the modernization stands the unification of many different commands into a single `gdal` command[^examples], along with more consistent parameter names and order.[^keithjenkins]

If you'd like to catch up on these recent GDAL development: The PSC has published both [the webinar slides](https://download.osgeo.org/gdal/presentations/GDAL%20CLI%20Modernization.pdf) and [the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKdrYm3TiBU) (52 minutes). Additionally, at the end of the slide deck, 10 slides have been added summarizing the most important questions and answers that came up during the session.

[^examples]: You can see some *before-after* examples of the simplication [here](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/05-12-gdal-3-11-released-with-new-gdal-program/) or, of course, in the [migration guide](https://gdal.org/en/latest/programs/migration_guide_to_gdal_cli.html#migration-guide-to-gdal-cli).
