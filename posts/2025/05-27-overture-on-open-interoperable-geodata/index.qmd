Grid[^grid] features [an interview with 
Jennings Anderson](https://gridisnotajournal.de/articles/anderson-2025-overture/) who works as 
a Software Engineer for Meta, has done research on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and is 
currently interested in the [Overture Maps Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overture_Maps_Foundation) (OMF) (of which Meta is a founding member). 

From the [interview](https://gridisnotajournal.de/articles/anderson-2025-overture/):

> *The literal meaning of overture is "an introduction to something more 
> substantial" or "a piece at the beginning of an opera". Is Overture an 
> introduction to something bigger?*
> 
> (...) It’s about doing what hasn’t been done before: combining various open 
> data sets into a consistent schema, which could lead to a new ecosystem of 
> map services and tools built around a high-quality base map of open data. 
> It’s the start of a new era of map tooling, where data is easier to use and 
> more interoperable.

Overall an interesting (albeit, clearly *inside*) view on OMF, OSM, and the evolution 
of geodata in general.

[^grid]: Grid (tagline: "is not a journal") has been published since fall 2024 
and [describes itself](https://gridisnotajournal.de/%C3%BCber-grid/) as 
"deal[ing] with the mutual transformations of society, technology and space in 
the age of digital media, infrastructures, data and algorithms". The aim of 
grid is to create a publication format that enables an exchange among 
scientists, but also makes this exchange accessible to a broader public.
