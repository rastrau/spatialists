Few weeks ago, [Brian Monheiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-monheiser/) has issued a 
call on LinkedIn: 

> Who are the top 10 living geospatial thought leaders whose insights you prioritize, 
whose talks you never miss, and whose writings you always read?

And the [results are in](https://thespatialjefe.substack.com/p/geospatials-brightest-minds-142-thought). 

But first: Personally, I strongly dislike the term "thought leaders." For one, I don't like my 
thoughts to be led all that much. Second, it rings a bit hollow to me and evokes the *bad* 
aspects of LinkedIn as well as hard- or soft-paywalled Medium and 
[Substack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack#Criticism) posts^[I view the last two 
as an anti-pattern for knowledge sharing and community building, unfortunately]. That said, I 
like how the rest of the question is phrased: *... whose insights you prioritize, whose talks 
you never miss, and whose writings you always read?*

Of course, the afore-mentioned call suffers from network / bubble effects *(who has seen / 
shared / heeded the LinkedIn call?)*. As such, many names are from the English-speaking 
world^[Brian's [post](https://thespatialjefe.substack.com/p/geospatials-brightest-minds-142-thought) has maps] 
and also traditionally male. 

With that out of the way: I find the list nevertheless interesting. It definitely features 
some very inspiring people and I am considering to connect with, or at least 
follow, some of them (I follow^[or followed, on Twitter] some of them already).

Below, I 
researched (hopefully correctly^[[corrections welcome](mailto:mail@spatialists.ch)], it wasn't 
always trivial with some of the more common names) the LinkedIn profiles and current job titles 
and affiliations of 
[those geospatial experts that were submitted at least twice](https://thespatialjefe.substack.com/p/geospatials-brightest-minds-142-thought):
