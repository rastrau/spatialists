Much (but – judging from experience – not yet enough) metaphorical ink has 
been spilled on this cartographic topic: Which kind of metrics lend themselves 
to be mapped using a choropleth map^[i.e., a thematic map that uses different 
colors or shading of areas to represent data]. Or, the other way around: How 
should I prepare my data in order to use it in a choropleth map?

Cartographer [Heather Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-smith-95676689) 
has produced a [video](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7294819040991092736) 
that explains the factors requiring data normalization as well as some 
techniques for normalization in very simple terms:

The techniques shown are not tied to any particular software. The video is part 
of a three-part series on designing choropleth maps with
