Two deadlines for the 2025 instalment of the prestigious bi-annual Prix 
Carto^[Transparency note: I'm part of the jury team.], awarded by the 
[Swiss Society of Cartography](https://kartografie.ch) (SSC), are approaching: 

- Submissions until April 30 will be part of the Map Exhibition at the 
[International Cartographic Conference](https://icaci.org/icc/) (ICC) in 
Vancouver. 
- The window for Prix Carto 2025 submissions will definitely close on June 30.

[Submissions for the 2025 awards can be handed in online](https://kartografie.ch/prix-carto/).

For context: The SSC Prix Carto award night will be held in autumn. The event 
celebrates innovative and outstanding cartographic products with a connection to 
Switzerland. The Prix Carto highlights excellence in cartography, geomatics, and 
geovisualization, offering recognition across multiple categories.

Besides its main category, the Prix Carto also includes two special awards to 
foster young talent: the "Prix Carto – start", aimed at school students and 
apprentices, and the "Prix Carto – edu", designed for university students and 
adults in training programs. Both of the "young talent" awards carry a prize of 
500 Swiss Francs.
