I stumbled upon this completely haphazardly, but [swisstopo plans to open its doors to the public on Saturday, 24th of May](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/open-day-at-swisstopo-2025):

> From maps and aerial photographs, coordinate systems and 3D models to national borders and documentation of the underground: Find out more about the many and varied tasks of swisstopo and how our work supports you every day. This is your opportunity to take a look behind the scenes at swisstopo and talk to our experts.

I'll save the date. More details will likely follow.
