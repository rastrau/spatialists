It seems, starting today, the Office for Geoinformation of the Canton of 
Thurgau (State of Thurgovia) has 
[a LinkedIn presence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amt-f√ºr-geoinformation-kanton-thurgau/):

> Welcome to the official website of the Thurgau Office for Geoinformation! 
üó∫Ô∏è üìç We look forward to informing you here about our exciting projects, 
developments and success stories.

This made me wonder, how many other cantonal geoinformation offices have a 
similar presence. The list is *very* 
short^[[additions welcome!](mailto:mail@spatialists.ch)] (there are 26 Swiss 
states):

- Geneva: [Syst√®me d'information du territoire √† Gen√®ve (SITG)](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/sitg-geneve/)
- Thurgovia: [Amt f√ºr Geoinformation Kanton Thurgau](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amt-f√ºr-geoinformation-kanton-thurgau) 
- Zug: [Amt f√ºr Grundbuch und Geoinformation Kanton Zug](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amt-f√ºr-grundbuch-und-geoinformation)

I welcome all additions to the geospatial online ecosystem (and the broader 
"digital" and "data" ecosystem), as any exchange among professionals in our 
industry is valuable. Let's build 
[smart networks](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2015/09/10/a-diverse-twitter-network-can-generate-better-ideas/).
