description: "Discover #Mapterhorn by Oliver Wipfli: a collection of global 
#terrain tiles in the lightweight #PMTiles format, built from open data sources 
such as Switzerlandâ€™s ultra-detailed #swissALTI3D model by #swisstopo. With 
open-source pipelines, ready-to-use code samples, and a live viewer, Mapterhorn 
makes it easy to add hillshaded relief and detailed 3D terrain to your webmaps."

From Oliver Wipfli comes [Mapterhorn](https://mapterhorn.com/)^[A pun on "map" and the famous [Matterhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matterhorn).], a collection of 
terrain tiles in [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) format 
compiled from [open data sources](https://mapterhorn.com/attribution/). In 
Switzerland, Mapterhorn uses [swissALTI3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/height-model-swissalti3d), swisstopo's high-resolution (0.5 meters!) terrain data. For the rest of the world, it currently relies on the [Copernicus DEM](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/collections-description/COP-DEM) at 30 meters resolution. The [roadmap](https://mapterhorn.com/) lists 
further high-resolution datasets that are scheduled to be added to Mapterhorn. 

You can check out the available data using the 
[Mapterhorn viewer](https://mapterhorn.com/viewer/#map=11.38/47.0031/7.9137).

There are [code samples](https://mapterhorn.com/examples/) using 
[MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) that demonstrate how Mapterhorn can be used 
to add a hill-shaded relief to a webmap or 3D terrain and hillshading to an 
OpenStreetMap raster map. And Oliver has made the code behind Mapterhorn, including 
its data processing pipelines, [open-source](https://github.com/mapterhorn/mapterhorn) 
under the BSD-3 licence.
