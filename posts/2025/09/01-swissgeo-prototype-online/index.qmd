SWISSGEO is "the Swiss Geospatial Platform‚Äù: It aims to unite various map, 
service, and data offerings from federal, cantonal, and communal Swiss 
authorities. As [previously reported](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/06/13-swissgeo-the-swiss-geospatial-platform/), in a first step the platform will 
gradually merge the federal geoportal geo.admin.ch, the intercantonal portal 
geodienste.ch, the catalog of geographical data for Switzerland, and more.

Now, you can give the very first SWISSGEO prototype a try at 
[test.swissgeo.ch](https://test.swissgeo.ch/). The organization behind SWISSGEO 
collects feedback through online forms: [in German](https://www.geoinformation.ch/de/swissgeo-feedback-de) and [in French](https://www.geoinformation.ch/fr/swissgeo-feedback-fr).
