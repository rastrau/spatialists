[Basemapkit](https://github.com/jonathanlurie/basemapkit) is a new open-source 
collection of basemap styles to be used with 
[Maplibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) and data from the 
[Protomaps](https://protomaps.com) 
[OSM pmtiles builds](https://maps.protomaps.com/builds/). At the time of 
writing, Basemapkit supports 41 languages. For now, Basemapkit contains one 
base style called "avenue". From the creator, Jonathan Lurie:

> The main idea behind avenue is to be a one-size-fits-all, a basemap that one 
can pull whenever they need a basemap, and it’s magically going to work just 
fine. Such a magically versatile basemap is probably not going to ever exist, 
but that’s my attempt.

And:

> One of the key design rules for avenue is that there are ~no~ outrageously 
fake colors. Highways are not yellow, and the most rule-bending symbology is 
cycling lanes to be dashed+green and tunnels/bridges to be white.

Most recently, Jonathan has added relief shading to Basemapkit. Basemapkit 
offers to options: Mapterhorn (previously 
[covered here](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/09/02-mapterhorn-terrain-tiles/)) 
and Mapzen.

Through color manipulation, the *avenue* base style is branched out into 
currently 9 different presets that come with Basemapkit. Users can also 
[modify *avenue*](https://github.com/jonathanlurie/basemapkit/tree/main#getting-creative-with-buildstyle) for their individual use case themselves.

There is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonathanlurie/basemapkit) as well as two articles by Jonathan detailling the design and the technical background: 
*"[Basemapkit: web basemaps for the people](https://jonathanlurie.substack.com/p/basemapkit-intro)"* and *"[Basemapkit: Let's explore the mountains!](https://jonathanlurie.substack.com/p/basemapkit-lets-explore-the-mountains)"*.
