description: "An analysis drawing on ecosyste.ms data reveals that a large 
share of #opensource projects are maintained by just one person, for example 
nearly half of the 13,000 most-downloaded #NPM packages, with this pattern 
holding for all but the largest download counts. This insight puts a spotlight 
on the need to carefully think about project and #community health in the 
modern #software landscape."

Motivated by an IT security story, [Josh Bressers looks into patterns of 
contributions to open-source software](https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/08-oss-one-person/) using data from the world's most 
comprehensive dataset about open-source production and use, 
[ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms). From the [article "Open Source is one person"](https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/08-oss-one-person/):

> About half of the 13,000 most downloaded NPM packages are ONE PERSON. We 
can change the download number and the graph stays this shape. Itâ€™s not until 
I change downloads to 1 billion downloads that we see 1 package maintained by 
1 person, and 9 packages maintained by more than 1.
> 
> This is open source. Open source is one person, even the popular stuff.

Food for thought with respect to project health and community sustainability.
