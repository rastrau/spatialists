Hot off the ~~press~~ collaborative coding platform: A [pull request](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-spatial/pull/677) introducing `ST_AsMVT` and `ST_AsMVTGeom` has been merged into the DuckDB `spatial` extension. Similar to PostGIS, these two new functions will allow DuckDB to serve vector tiles in the Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format. 

[Max Gabrielsson](https://github.com/Maxxen) has published a 160-line gist^[A short piece of code hosted on GitHub] demonstrating how to set up a Flask^[A Python framework for web apps] app that serves vector tiles from DuckDB in a webmap.

The [idea](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-spatial/issues/241#issue-2106636783) first emerged in January of last year. The feature is [scheduled to ship in DuckDB version 1.4](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-spatial/issues/241#issuecomment-3184208108) next week!
