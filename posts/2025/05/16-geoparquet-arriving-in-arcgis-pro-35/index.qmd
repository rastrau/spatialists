description: "With version 3.5, users can now natively work with #GeoParquet files in #ArcGIS Pro, either by creating multifile feature connections or by accessing individual #Parquet files stored locally or in Amazon #S3. This streamlines the integration of #cloudnative data, though currently with specific requirements and limitations."

Update from the cloud-native front: With version 3.5, ArcGIS Pro now has [native support for the cloud-native GeoParquet format](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/parquet/parquet-in-arcgis.htm): 

> Beginning with ArcGIS Pro 3.5, there are two ways you can work with Apache Parquet files. Each serves a different purpose and has different requirements as follows:
> 
> - Create a multifile feature connection from multiple Parquet files that have the same schema (...)
> - Access a single Parquet file stored on a local drive or in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket

The GeoParquet support comes with specific requirements and limitations, which are detailed [in the documentation](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/parquet/parquet-in-arcgis.htm) and in an [accompanying FAQ on "using a Parquet file in ArcGIS Pro"](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/parquet/faqs-parquet-in-maps.htm).
