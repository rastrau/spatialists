The data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the data from the Overture Maps Foundation (OMF; in parts, of course, also OSM data) can 
be valuable resources. However, accessing and using this data is not straight-forward for everybody. 

Via the 
[Swiss Territorial Data Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/swiss-territorial-data-lab-stdl_we-at-the-stdl-are-used-to-working-with-activity-7324018620877922305-kfXZ), 
I have learned about two new tools that, depending on your expertise and current workflow may make accessing and using OSM and OMF easier:

- [QuackOSM](https://github.com/kraina-ai/quackosm) is a tool for reading OSM data in the `PBF`[^PBF] format using DuckDB and its 
`spatial` extension. QuackOSM can filter OSM data based on geometry and thematically using OSM key-value tags.

- [OvertureMaestro](https://github.com/kraina-ai/overturemaestro) is tool for reading OMF data and saving it to GeoParquet. 
It can filter OMF data based on geometry or using `PyArrow` expressions.

Both tools are based on Python and open-source. They use multi-threading and caching, and can be used as Python modules as well 
as on the command line. The tools are developed by [Kraina AI](https://kraina.ai/), the Geospatial & Mobility Research Group at 
the Wroc≈Çaw University for Science and Technology.
