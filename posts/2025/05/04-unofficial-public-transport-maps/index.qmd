[Lars' Transport Maps](https://larstransportmaps.com/) is the project of a transport planner based in Switzerland who "love[s] travelling through Europe by train and creating transport maps". The site features a growing collection of visually appealing, though unofficial, public transport maps. So, far the following countries are included: 

- Austria
- Belgium
- Denmark
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Sweden and
- Switzerland

The maps cover the regular train network, general train services, high-speed trains, long-distance trains, and night trains, among others. Many of the maps appear to receive annual updates.

The [Swiss train network](https://larstransportmaps.com/2022/02/09/the-evolution-of-long-distance-traffic-in-switzerland-since-1982/) is covered in particularly great detail with [an article and a series of maps tracing changes since 1982](https://larstransportmaps.com/2022/02/09/the-evolution-of-long-distance-traffic-in-switzerland-since-1982/).

All the maps are worth exploring; personally, I found the [French high-speed train network](https://larstransportmaps.com/2025/02/23/high-speed-rail-in-france-2025/) especially striking.
