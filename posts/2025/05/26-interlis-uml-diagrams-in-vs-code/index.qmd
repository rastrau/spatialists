[geowerkstatt](https://www.geowerkstatt.ch) has updated their 
[plug-in "INTERLIS 2"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geowerkstatt.InterlisLanguageSupport) 
for [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
Starting with version 0.3.0, the plug-in has the ability to automatically draw the 
(live) UML^[Unified Modeling Language] class diagram of Interlis models 
(`ili` files). The UML diagrams can be exported (and refined) as 
SVG files^[Scalable Vector Graphics, an open standard for two-dimensional vector 
graphics] or in Mermaid syntax^[[Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) 
is a JavaScript-based diagramming tool that takes Markdown-inspired text 
definitions and creates diagrams dynamically. Mermaid is supported in GitHub, 
for example.]. In my quick tests, the drawing feature *mostly* worked; it 
couldn't render *some* models^[In my random sample, 
`Amphibien_Laichgebiete_V1_2.ili`, `BLN_V1_2.ili`, and 
`Flachmoore_V1_2.ili` didn't render visually. I haven't tested them in the 
[umleditor](https://www.interlis.ch/en/downloads/umleditor).].

Here is part of the [`ARA_DB_REP_V1_2`](https://models.geo.admin.ch/BAFU/)
model as drawn by the geowerkstatt plug-in:

![UML diagram of the model "[ARA_DB_REP_V1_2](https://models.geo.admin.ch/BAFU/)"](ARA_DB_REP_V1_2.ili-diagram.png 'UML diagram of the model "ARA_DB_REP_V1_2"')

The plug-in continuous to offer the following features:

- Syntax highlighting of object names, data types, keywords, and string patterns for `ili` files
- Snippets for commonly used Interlis blocks (`MODEL`, `TOPIC`, `CLASS`, `STRUCTURE`, `ASSOCIATION`, and `Role`)
- Auto-generation of documentation in Markdown for `ili` files

The plug-in is [open-source](https://github.com/GeoWerkstatt/vsc_interlis2_extension) under the MIT license.
