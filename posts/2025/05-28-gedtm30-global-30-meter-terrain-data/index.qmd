description: "A team of researchers has released #GEDTM30, a global #DigitalTerrainModel with 30-meter (1 arcsecond) resolution, generated through #MachineLearning fusion of various data sources, and accompanied by 15 geomorphometric parameters computed at multiple spatial scales. Published under a CC-BY license, GEDTM30 offers open, high-resolution global terrain data and is accessible as cloud-optimized #GeoTIFF-s (#COG) via Zenodo and OpenLandMap."

A group of researchers has published "GEDTM30"^["GEDTM" stands for "Global 
ensemble digital terrain model".] a new high-resolution^[For global coverage, 
30 meter is considered high-resolution.] DTM^[Digital terrain model, 
that is a model of the "bare earth" elevations of the Earth's surface.] of 
global extent. GEDTM30 has 1 arcsecond spatial resolution, which is about 
30 meters. 

A [pre-print](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6280607/v1)^[That is, a 
scientific publication that has not yet been peer-reviewed.] (currently) 
describes the production method: 

> Copernicus DEM, ALOS World3D, and object height models were combined in a 
> data fusion approach to generate a globally consistent DTM. (...) A 
> global-to-local transfer learning model framework with 5°×5° tiling leveraged 
> globally distributed lidar datasets: ICESat-2 ATL08 (...) and GEDI02 (...). 
> A global model was initially fitted using ICESat-2 and GEDI, followed by 
> locally optimized models per tile, ensuring both global consistency and 
> local accuracy.

Also interesting: The DTM itself is accompanied by 15 geomorphometric 
parameters computed by the researchers at six spatial scales (30, 60, 120, 240, 
480 and 960 meters):

- Difference from Mean Elevation
- Geomorphons
- LS Factor
- Maximal Curvature
- Minimal Curvature
- Negative Openness
- Positive Openness
- Profile Curvature
- Ring Curvature
- Shape Index
- Slope in Degree
- Specific Catchment Area
- Spherical Standard Deviation of the Normals
- Tangential Curvature
- Topographic Wetness Index

through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15490367) and the [OpenLandMap STAC^[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog]](https://stac.openlandmap.org/). The data format is Cloud-optimized 
GeoTIFF. The [pre-print](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6280607/v1) has more
