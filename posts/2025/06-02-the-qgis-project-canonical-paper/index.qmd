[Anita Graser](https://fosstodon.org/@underdarkGIS), [Tim Sutton](https://fosstodon.org/@timlinux), and [Marco Bernasocchi](https://fosstodon.org/@mbernasocchi) (all members of the [QGIS Project Steering Committee](https://qgis.org/community/organisation/)) have published the canonical paper[^canonical] on the QGIS project: "[The QGIS project: Spatial without compromise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389925001138)"[^title]. The paper is ["open access" at ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389925001138). From the introduction:

> QGIS is available across a wide range of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS, as well as mobile applications for Android and iOS. Efforts are also under way to develop a browser-based version using web assembly. The software has been translated into over 100 languages, with 20 translations covering more than 75% of the application’s functionality.

The paper positions the QGIS project in the GIS "ecosystem" and describes the evolution of the project through the following phases (authors' words, not mine):

- Origins and early development (2002–2007)
- Expansion of capabilities and infrastructure (2008–2012)
- The QGIS.ORG association and organizational maturity (2013–2017)
- Transition to QGIS 3 and the path forward (2018–present)

It details the project's (Switzerland-based) organization, the software release management process, the infrastructure management, the project budget (approximately, EUR 400,000 in 2024; but beware: this sum does not equate to the total amount invested in QGIS), (very high-level) features,  broad typical use-cases, a brief overview over the plug-in collection, and usage numbers, among others. 

I like[^dislike] that [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389925001138) concludes with [5 key challenges to the QGIS project and potential solutions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389925001138#sec3). 

[^canonical]: A canonical paper is a foundational academic publication that 
is intended to serve as the standard reference for a topic, in this case the 
QGIS project.

[^title]: The title refers to the, I think relatively new (?), 
[tag line](https://qgis.org/) of the project.

[^dislike]: Minor dislike, but it doesn't detract too much from the rest: The 
paper mentions the cliché that, allegedly, "80% of all data contains a 
geograpical component" (at least not: "... is spatial."). See 
[here](https://digital.ebp.ch/2024/10/20/schweizer-geoinformation-2024-connecting-the-dots-perpetual-beta/) for data on 
this point (in German).
