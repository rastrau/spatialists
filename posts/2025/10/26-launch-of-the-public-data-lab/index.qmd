Zurich, bringing together experts from academia, public administration, and the 
#opendata community to explore how #data can illuminate social, environmental, 
and economic change. Through research, design, and public engagement, the PDL 
aims to create meaningful indicators that help shape informed decisions for a 
sustainable and equitable future."

Last Thursday, the DIZH[^dizh] [Public Data Lab](https://publicdatalab.ch) 
(PDL) held its [launch event](https://publicdatalab.ch/event/launch-event/) in 
Zurich.[^transp] Matthias Mazenauer, Co-Head of the Statistical Office of the 
Canton of Zurich, has posted some [impressions on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthiasmazenauer_publicdatalab-dizh-zaesrich-activity-7387215203610013696-hjv2). 

From the PDL website:

> Changes in society, the economy, and the environment pose major challenges 
for the canton of Zurich. According to its constitution, it has a mandate to 
maintain the quality of life of its population and to ensure sustainable 
ecological, economic, and social development.

The PDL aims to collect and analyze data to understand what drives change and 
how the society responds. It aims to combine data into indicators that measure 
quality of life and support informed decisions. Through art, design, and public 
exhibitions, the PDL also plans to raise awareness of how indicators connect to 
social, political, and ethical contexts.

The PDL consists of representatives from the four institutions:

- Statistical Office of the Canton of Zurich
- University of Zurich (UZH)
- Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK)
- Opendata.ch

The University of Zurich participates in the PDL with the [Department of 
Mathematical Modeling and Machine Learning](https://dm3l.uzh.ch/) and 
the [Department of Geography](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/). While the initiative is 
still very young, the PDL website (in German) already lists some 
[flagship](https://publicdatalab.ch/projekte/leuchtturmprojekte/) and 
[associated projects](https://publicdatalab.ch/projekte/assoziierte_projekte/) 
some of which involve geospatial analysis, for example:

- the creation of a spatial index of multiple deprivation (Flagship Project 2)
- the development of indicators of well-being in green spaces using deep 
learning, StreetView imagery, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and geodata 
(Flagship Project 3) and 
- the development of a spatial index of potential energy scarcity (associated 
project).

The PDL is funded until 2029.

[^dizh]: The [DIZH](https://www.dizh.uzh.ch) is the "Digitalization Initiative 
of the Zurich Higher Education Institutions". The University of Zurich (UZH), 
the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), the Zurich University of the 
Arts (ZHdK) and the Zurich University of Teacher Education (PHZH) form the DIZH 
network. The [mission](https://www.dizh.uzh.ch/en/about-us/mission/) of the DIZH 
is to "promote cooperation on digitalization issues between higher education 
institutions in Zurich, thereby strengthening the greater Zurich area as a hub 
for research and business".
