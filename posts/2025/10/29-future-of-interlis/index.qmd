The [Interlis Discourse Forum](https://interlis.discourse.group) features a 
[discussion (in German, so far) among a number of experts](https://interlis.discourse.group/t/gedanken-zur-zukunft-von-interlis/448/6) on the future of this Swiss modeling 
language and geodata exchange standard.

The occasion is the [announcement](https://blog.sourcepole.ch/2025/10/24/gedanken-zur-zukunft-von-interlis/) 
by Pirmin Kalberer about his retreat from the [SOGI GGMM](Geonormen und 
modellbasierte Methode (GGMM))[^sogiggm] and an earlier Interlis-centric 
working group. Pirmin reflects on Interlis support in GDAL, strenghts and 
weaknesses of Interlis and ideas for the future.

In somewhat related news: [Slides and materials](https://interlis.discourse.group/t/v-interlis-anwender-innen-treffen-rencontre-des-utilisateurs-interlis/424/9) 
for the upcoming (fifth) Interlis User Group Meeting were published today.

[^sogiggm]: The [SOGI GGMM](https://www.sogi.ch/de/netzwerke/standards) is the 
working group on "geonorms and the model-based method" of the [Swiss 
Organization for Geoinformation](https://www.sogi.ch/en) (SOGI/OSIG).
