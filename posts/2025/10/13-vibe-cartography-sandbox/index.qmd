description: 'David Oesch has open-sourced his workflow for generating 
#AI-driven #topographicmaps directly from #aerialimagery, following his 
earlier experiment in "vibe cartography". The GitHub repository lets anyone 
reproduce the method using Python and a Google account, while also inviting 
collaboration on the proposed future improvements.'

Roughly two weeks ago, David Oesch 
([previously](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/10/01-vibing-cartography/)) 
published an [experiment in vibe cartography](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidoesch_map-generation-geospatial-share-7379129418557997056-b8Ci). 
Now, David has [open-sourced his approach for directly producing a topographic 
map from aerial imagery using AI](https://github.com/davidoesch/ai-topographic-maps)^[Specifically, a large language model (LLM) 
and a large multimodal model (LMM).] and his experimental results on GitHub. 

The repository enables anybody to reproduce David's approach (using Python 
3.8+ and a Google account) and to maybe collaborate towards the "[Future 
improvements](https://github.com/davidoesch/ai-topographic-maps?tab=readme-ov-file#future-improvements)" 
outlined.
