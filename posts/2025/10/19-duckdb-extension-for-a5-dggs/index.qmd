description: "A community extension by Query.Farm brings native support for the (equal-area, pentagonal-cell-based) #A5 Discrete Global Grid System (#DGGS) to #DuckDB. In development since April, the extension includes a set of functions for coordinate conversion, geometry, hierarchy, and utilities, extending DuckDBâ€™s reach into high-performance spatial analysis."

Have missed this until now: [Query.Farm](https://query.farm/) developed and develops a [DuckDB community extension](https://github.com/Query-farm/a5) that supports the [A5](https://a5geo.org/) DGGS^[Discrete Global Grid System] (see [here](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/09/05-discrete-global-grid-systems/index.html) for more background). 

Development started in April. Looking at the [repo](https://github.com/rustyconover/a5-geo), the internal version number seems to be at 0.4.2. Somewhat confusingly, the [documentation](https://query.farm/duckdb_extension_a5.html#license) puts the extension under the MIT license, while the [repo](https://github.com/felixpalmer/a5) itself carries the Apache 2.0 license.

[Current functionality](ttps://query.farm/duckdb_extension_a5.html) encompasses the following: 

- Conversion functions: 
  - `a5_lonlat_to_cell`
  - `a5_cell_to_lonlat`
- Core / geometry functions:
  - `a5_cell_to_boundary`
  - `a5_cell_area`
  - `a5_get_resolution`
- Hierarchy / relationship functions:
  - `a5_cell_to_children`
  - `a5_cell_to_parent`
- Utility functions:
  - `a5_get_num_cells`
  - `a5_get_res0_cells`
