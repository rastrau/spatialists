[secretsofmaps.com](https://www.secretsofmaps.com/) hosts a set of interactive visualizations of various routing algorithms: *BFS*^[Breadth-First Search], *DFS*^[Depth-First Search], *Bidirectional BFS*, *Greedy*, *A&ast;*, *Bidirectional A&ast;*, and *A&ast; plus Lookup Table*. The whole site is a kind of interactive tutorial that guides you sequentally through the routing algorithms.

The [site](https://www.secretsofmaps.com/) says "How does Google Maps work? – Explore the algorithm". But as far as I could see the site is not affiliated with Google. It is built by [Adam Kulikowski](https://adamkulik.com/) based on [earlier work](https://honzaap.github.io/Pathfinding/) by [Jan Pánek](https://jan-panek.cz/).

Recommendation for the more trivial algorithms: Use the slider to speed up the animations.
