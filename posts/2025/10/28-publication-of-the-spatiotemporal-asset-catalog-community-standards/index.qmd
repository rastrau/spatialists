There is big news from the OGC^[Open Geospatial Consortium]. From [today's anouncement](https://www.ogc.org/announcement/ogc-announces-publication-of-the-spatiotemporal-asset-catalog-community-standards/):

> The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is pleased to announce the publication 
of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) Community Standards. The STAC family 
of specifications aims to standardize how geospatial asset metadata are 
structured and queried. (...)

STAC is purposefully built around a lightweight core and can be adapted using 
extensions to the standard. 

> Initially designed for satellite imagery, STAC has evolved to support a wide 
range of data resources and formats, including aircraft and drone imagery; 
hyperspectral, optical, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data; video; point 
clouds; lidar; digital elevation models (DEM); vector data; machine learning 
labels; and composites like NDVI and mosaics.

The STAC specifications include the following:

- [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) Community Standard](https://docs.ogc.org/cs/25-004/25-004.html)
- [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) API Community Standard](https://docs.ogc.org/cs/25-005/25-005.html)

Like always with OGC standards, these documents are freely accessible. 

See also the [stacspec.org](https://stacspec.org/en/) for a large collection of 
valuable resources around STAC.
