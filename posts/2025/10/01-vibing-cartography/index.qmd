From David Oesch comes an enticing experiment^[From me comes the somewhat subversive "vibe cartography".]: [AI-driven topographic map generation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidoesch_map-generation-geospatial-share-7379129418557997056-b8Ci), inspired by an earlier [experiment by Christian HÃ¼ttich](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-christian-h%C3%BCttich-04542539_generative-ki-ver%C3%A4ndert-gerade-die-spielregeln-activity-7376483274405191680-2U3K).

The [process as explained by David](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidoesch_map-generation-geospatial-share-7379129418557997056-b8Ci) involves using an LLM^[Large language model] to translate JSON-based webmap style specifications into a prompt for an LMM^[Large multi-modal model]. Feed the prompt (that e.g. specifies color values, line widths, line casing widths, etc.) and an aerial image into a suitable LMM^[Probably *Nano Banana AI* within *Gemini*, if I read the LinkedIn post and the LMM prompt correctly.] and wait.  

David's result:

Clever workflow! And impressive[^procon], low-effort results. I'm not sure if consistency and scalability[^note] is truly given, though?

[^procon]: Pro, for example: Check out the shadow removal. Con, for example: Imagined bathymetry.
[^note]: For example: Are the graphic specifications (always) adhered to? What is the performance for a given image resolution and surface area? If a tiling / roving window approach is chosen to cover a large area: How would one ensure geometric and topological consistency along tile / window borders?
