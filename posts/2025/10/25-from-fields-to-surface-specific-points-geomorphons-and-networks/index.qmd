description: 'David O’Sullivan’s latest post in his "GIS, a Transformational 
Approach" series explores how geospatial data transitions between continuous 
#fields and discrete forms like #points, #lines, and #areas. Using 
#geomorphometry concepts such as surface-specific points, geomorphons, and 
surface networks as an example, the data transformations are illustrated using 
#R-based workflows.'

In the [latest blogpost](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-10-23-gia-chapter-1B-part-4/) 
of his [*"GIS, a transformational approach"* series](https://dosull.github.io/blog.html#category=transformational%20approach), David O'Sullivan looks into 
transformations from fields^[Think, for example, a digital elevation model or a 
rainfall intensity raster.] to points and from fields to lines.

David centers the [blog post](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-10-23-gia-chapter-1B-part-4/) 
on the analysis of a DEM^[Digital elevation model] and thus introduces several 
interesting concepts from geomorphometry^[The science of measuring and 
quantifying terrain or the the shape of the Earth's surface.] –
[surface-specific points](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-10-23-gia-chapter-1B-part-4/#to-points)[^ssp], geomorphons (short for "geomorphologic phonotypes"), 
[courses](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-10-23-gia-chapter-1B-part-4/#to-lines), 
thalwegs, and surface networks – demonstrates how to compute these features 
using R and highlights methodological challenges.

It's a great concise introduction to some geomorphological concepts. The rest 
of the ["Transformational" series](https://dosull.github.io/blog.html#category=transformational%20approach) 
(one article still to come) is also worth reading, particularly if you use R 
for geospatial tasks. And the article has me wonder about 
[surface networks](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-10-23-gia-chapter-1B-part-4/#a-pause-for-breath): 

> The surface network representation allows the terrain to be partitioned into 
hills (regions surrounded by thalwegs) and dales (regions surrounded by ridges). 
(...) surface networks deserve more attention than they’ve gotten from the 
community over the decades, but their reliable construction has proved elusive. 
Perhaps now that there is at least one tool out there that is up to the task 
they’ll make their way into the mainstream (...).

[^ssp]: David's article mentions this law on the number of surface-specific 
points (where *n* means "number of"):<br> *n<sub>pass</sub>* &minus; 
*n<sub>pit</sub>* &minus; *n<sub>peak</sub>* = 2<br>I remember this law being 
(implicitly) stated by J.C. Maxwell in his publication *On Hills and Dales* (I 
didn't remember the year, so I looked it up: in 1870, based on earlier work by 
Arthur Cayley) – probably because of its simplicity but also specificity. 
I remember, because I cited Maxwell and Cayley in my 
[PhD thesis](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/entities/publication/10fe2656-34dd-49eb-a623-4a6c2b58e4a7).
