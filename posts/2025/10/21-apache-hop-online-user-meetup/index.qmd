On 18 November, there will be an online meetup for the (German-speaking^[The program contains items in English, but is certainly German-dominated.]) [Apache Hop](https://hop.apache.org) user community. Apache Hop^["Hop" stands for "Hop Orchestration Platform". While the wordmark looks like "HOP" is all upper-case, the copy of the official website actually calls it "Hop".] is an open-source platform (under the Apache v2 license) that – in its own words and certainly in the hopes of some industry stakeholders – "aims to be the future of data integration."

The [registration form for the user meetup](https://data.it-novum.com/termine/apache-hop-user-meetup/) is available online. Participation is free of charge. The [program](https://data.it-novum.com/termine/apache-hop-user-meetup/) also features a talk by Stefan Keller that specifically discusses spatial data integration and manipulation. In August, Stefan Keller has already hosted a [webinar centered on Hop](https://www.geowebforum.ch/t/webinar-ki-gestuetzte-enterprise-und-geo-datenintegration-und-apache-hop-26-08-2025-11-12-uhr/1185) and he occasionally posts about Hop in the [GEOWebforum](https://www.geowebforum.ch)^[Sic.].
