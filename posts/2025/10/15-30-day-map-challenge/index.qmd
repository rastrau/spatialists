'tis the season again: The [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) 
by [Topi Tjukanov](https://github.com/tjukanovt) is approaching. Started in 
2019^[Back then, on Twitter, I think?], the #30DayMapChallenge calls upon 
cartographers, spatial data scientists, and GIS experts to produce a map a day 
during the month of November[^audience]. Each day, the 30 Day Map Challenge 
issues a (often, loose) theme:

works, if you are looking for inspiration. Some notable entries, include:

- The 2021 [collection by Achim Tack](https://www.achim-tack.org/30daymapchallenge)
- Meta-collections, for example by [David Frigge](https://david.frigge.nz/30DayMapChallenge/maps.html) and by [Aurelien Chaumet](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aurelien.chaumet/viz/30daymapchallenge/30DayMapChallenge-Week1?publish=yes)

Whether participating or observing: A month of cartographic (and often data 
analysis) inspiration is coming.

puts it: *No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before this 
challenge, everyone is welcome to participate.*
