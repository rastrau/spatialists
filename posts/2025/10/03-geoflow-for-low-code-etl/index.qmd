It feels like there is a gap in low-code[^lowcode] geospatial data manipulation 
tooling:

- There is, of course, Safe Software's very prominent state-of-the-art 
commercial offering [FME](https://fme.safe.com/)^[Feature Manipulation Engine.]. 
- There used to be [GeoKettle](https://sourceforge.net/p/geokettle/activity/?page=0&limit=100)[^kettle]. 
"Used", since the last release was 10 years ago.
- There is the [QGIS model designer](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing/modeler.html)[^graphicalmodeler] 
and the proprietary equivalent by Esri, 
[ModelBuilder](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/modelbuilder-quick-tour.htm).
- There is the, decidedly *non*-visual, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)-plugin 
[GRETL](https://github.com/sogis/gretl)^[Gradle ETL (extract-transform-load).] 
by the canton of Solothurn.
- There is [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/), if you will, albeit not truly 
geared towards geospatial data.
- And there is [Apache Hop](https://hop.apache.org/)^[Hop Orchestration 
Platform.].

While some of these seem promising[^hop], so far, none of these tools seems to 
really be able to scratch the itch for which many organizations reach for FME. 

But there is a new potential contender, as announced 
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordanrising_pointclouds-geospatial-gis-activity-7371701647929991168-jf-Y): 
[Geoflow](https://geoflow.dev/) is a set of tools for automating geospatial 
data workflows. 

[![Geoflow](geoflow.jpg "Geoflow")](https://geoflow.dev/)

It sports a visual interface ("Visual Workflow Builder") and 
is being developed as an open-source solution. Make sure to check the 
["Platform Overview Video"](https://geoflow.dev/).^[Sorry.] 

As the counter on the site suggests, [Geoflow](https://geoflow.dev/) has been 
under development for only a few weeks. So: definitely early days, but maybe a 
space to watch. It might lead to an interesting and sustainable open-source 
geospatial ETL^[Extract-transform-load.] solution.

[^lowcode]: Think: Visual, drag-and-drop-enabled, tools.
[^kettle]: Based on [Kettle](https://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-kettle) which 
is now "Pentaho Data Integration".
[^graphicalmodeler]: Formerly known as "graphical modeler".
[^hop]: In my opinion, especially the last one, Apache Hop.
