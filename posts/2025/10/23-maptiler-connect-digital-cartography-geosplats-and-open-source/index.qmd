description: '#MapTiler’s evolution from its #Klokantech origins to a global #mapping powerhouse is remarkable. Its first company event called "MapTiler Connect", showed why: Blending technical rigor with community spirit, it highlighted how open-source ideals, design, and cutting-edge #3D innovation can coexist in modern #cartography.'

I came across the company [MapTiler](https://maptiler.com) and its founder, [Petr Pidal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klokan/), in 2017 when it was still called [Klokantech](https://klokantech.com)[^1]. The company has progressed remarkably, currently boasting more than 9,000 clients and 500 million people per month viewing their maps![^2] Yesterday, I attended [MapTiler Connect](https://connect.maptiler.com/) in Zurich. Compared to the usual large GIS gatherings, this event achieved something rare: it combined genuine warmth, technical excellence, and a visible commitment to open-source. 

Three things presented at the event stuck with me:

- **Digital cartography done right.** MapTiler is doubling down on map quality. The level-of-detail slider was elegant, and the global rollout of relief generalization felt like a modern tribute to Eduard Imhof (and utilized [research by the ETH](https://ikgrelief.ethz.ch/design/generalization/)).
- **GeoSplats: Where Gaussian splatting meets maps.** Gaussian splatting is the current buzz in 3D technology, and MapTiler has extended it with *GeoSplats*: a tiling scheme for splats and integration with generative AI to enhance – or create – 3D scenes. We should watch what will happen in the future  at [geosplats.org](https://geosplats.org/).
- **A real open-source gesture.** The new MapTiler Foundation signals serious intent. A contribution of $100k isn’t symbolic, but substantial! I heard it even began as a grassroots employee initiative. The obvious pick for funding would be GDAL – because, frankly, everything in geospatial depends on it.

All in all, it was a well-run and inspiring event by a small team and with a list of interesting guests. Kudos to Petr and the MapTiler team!
