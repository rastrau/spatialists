The [Swiss Territorial Data Lab](https://www.stdl.ch) (STDL)[^name] is an initiative in the framework of the [Swiss Geoinformation Strategy](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/strategy-and-implementation) and it is funded from 2020 until the end of 2025. The goal of the STDL is to conduct innovative proofs-of-concept and feasibility studies using geodata and data science methods on behalf of Swiss authorities.

A short while ago, the STDL published their [2025 journal or report](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/publication?id=m7BmoKLkbRk0) (in [German](https://backend.swisstopo.admin.ch/fileservice/sdweb-docs-prod-swisstopoch-files/files/2025/07/24/3a4fc234-8a50-4c4a-90c1-957c9660d353.pdf) and in [French](https://backend.swisstopo.admin.ch/fileservice/sdweb-docs-prod-swisstopoch-files/files/2025/07/24/d45866f3-00fc-466f-8de3-5c390b028544.pdf)). In it, the STDL details some of the lab's achievements while also dedicating a significant portion of it to the organisational and methodological aspects and learnings from the past years.

If you are more interested in the technical and data science underpinnings of, and insights from, the STDL's work (including [source-code](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab)), <https://tech.stdl.ch> collects much material on these aspects as collected from the various conducted proofs-of-concept and exploratory projects.

[^name]: To my (non-native English-speaker) ears, the name has a slightly odd ring. I suspect it is a Gallicism. It should not mislead you, however: The Lab's work is not restricted to, nor even focussed on, territorial data in the narrow sense.
