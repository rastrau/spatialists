Last Wednesday in Switzerland, the Birch Glacier collapsed[^glaciology] under debris deposited from Kleines Nesthorn and buried parts of the (previously evacuated) village Blatten. 

Swisstopo has carried out a [Rapid Mapping campaign](https://bsky.app/profile/stim3on.bsky.social/post/3lqetp4i6tc2k)[^rm] on behalf of the Federal Office of the Environment. The [resulting geodata is openly available](https://www.rapidmapping.admin.ch/index_en.html) from Swisstopo. Thanks to the open nature of the Rapid Mapping data and the expertise of individuals, textured 3D models of the affected area have been quickly built and published: 

- Alexandre Cottier has published visualizations of [a pre-event](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexandre-cottier_switzerland-3d-nature-activity-7331686812924411904-L9zj) and 
[a post-event 3D model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexandre-cottier_3d-switzerland-metashape-activity-7334565796372779008-Gyq3)

- Similarly, Florian Denzinger has created "during [his] lunch break" [animations of](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7331380962225750020-3PDN) [a pre-event 3D model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7331382067294793732-Ykdq) of the Birch Glacier. The model can also be [explored interactively on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/blatten-rapid-mapping-flight-19052025-93260fad8b334aef94e6f8009d6e3f50). Florian Denzinger has followed up with an animated view of [a post-event model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7334325680119177217-bpGq) (I couldn't find an interactive version of this model).

- Simeon Schmauß has also created [an annotated post-event 3D model](https://fosstodon.org/@stim3on/114604248804517798) from the Swisstopo Rapid Mapping data (see below). This one can be [explored interactively on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/blatten-glacier-collapse-2025-05-30-037bb8933d2444d6b283da885ab77a8d).

- On Sunday afternoon, Simeon Schmauß has also published [a comparison of pre-event elevations with the post-event DEM](https://fosstodon.org/@stim3on/114607886463364529) extracted from the oblique Rapid Mapping imagery (see below). He's also made the [data available](https://fosstodon.org/@stim3on/114607899708612052).

[^glaciology]: The ETH Zurich has a [concise and informative brief about the event](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/05/what-eth-glacier-researchers-know-about-the-collapse-of-the-birchgletscher-glacier.html) as well as a [factsheet (pdf)](https://www.wsl.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/News/2025/05_Factsheet_Birchgletscher/88028-VAW-2025-05_Birchgletscher_Factsheet_20250529_WSL.pdf) from a glaciology perspective.
