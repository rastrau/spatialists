Many geospatial professions involve – varying degrees of – programming: GIS developer^[That is, developer of GIS software.], (geospatial) web or application developer, spatial data scientist and data engineer, GIS analyst, etc. In his [blog](https://endler.dev/), [Matthias Endler](https://endler.dev/about) has published [an article about traits that, in his opinion, the best programmers share](https://endler.dev/2025/best-programmers/). The article is not specifically about software development in the geospatial domain, but the points it lists are interesting and ought to transfer just fine to sub-disciplines of *developing*. 

From the intro to the [blog post](https://endler.dev/2025/best-programmers/):

> In the hope that this will be an inspiration to someone out there, I wrote down the traits I observed in the most exceptional people in our craft. I wish I had that list when I was starting out. Had I followed this path, it would have saved me a lot of time.
