Art with scientific merit: Cartographer [Dan Coe has popularized this type of visualization](https://dancoecarto.com/) of elevations along rivers and floodplains that have the [overall trend in river elevation removed](https://www.dnr.wa.gov/publications/ger_presentations_dmt_2016_coe.pdf). This technique leaves behind elevation fluctuations more or less relative to the river. Once the elevations in this "relative elevation model" (REM) are rendered, the data exposes – even shallow – current and historical fluvial geomorphology.

[OpenTopography](https://github.com/OpenTopography) offers [`RiverREM`](https://github.com/OpenTopography/RiverREM), a Python-based tool for generating and visualizing REMs automatically. The tool requires only a digital elevation model (DEM) and, optionally, a river centerline^[If no river centerline is given, the tool looks for one in OpenStreetMap, using the bounding box around the input DEM.] to run.
