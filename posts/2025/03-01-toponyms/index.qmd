Weekend diversion: Mapmakers (or their financers) got to name a lot of 
places. There's a [website](https://draeckgaden.ch/) and a 
[Mastodon account](https://tooting.ch/@flurnamen) that makes it 
its purpose to surface the sometimes odd and sometimes funny toponyms^[place names] 
that have found their way into the official Swisstopo maps (many are 
in German or Swiss-German) and their etymology. 
[Either](https://draeckgaden.ch/feed.xml) 
[outlet](https://tooting.ch/@flurnamen.rss) offers an RSS feed^[You 
can follow any Fediverse (e.g. [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) 
or [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/)) account through RSS, even if you 
are not part of the Fediverse. Simply add `.rss` the URL of their 
profile page. It's the open web, after all.].
