The concept "Elementary geodata for a digital Switzerland" ("[Elementare 
Geodaten für eine digitale 
Schweiz](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/dam/de/sd-web/XND7rodsPEYC/Konzept%20Georegister%20V1.1-de%20final.pdf)" 
(pdf) in German, "[Géodonnées élémentaires pour une Suisse 
numérique](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/dam/fr/sd-web/XND7rodsPEYC/Konzept%20Georegister%20V1.1-fr%20final.pdf)" 
(pdf) in French)[^transp] has been published on the swisstopo website.

The concept is a product of a project named "Georegisters". From the swisstopo 
website (auto-translated):

> Over the past 15 years, the federal government, cantons, and municipalities 
have developed information systems in the field of geoinformation on the basis 
of the Geoinformation Act (...) and other specialist legislation. 
>
> However, users of this information do not always have access to official geodata 
that is accessible via a central access point and represents the most up-to-date 
and homogeneous status possible throughout Switzerland. (...) 
>
> In order to meet the requirements of a digital society and administration, 
georegisters are being created and used in a binding manner in digital 
processes. The introduction of georegisters will modernize cooperation between 
the geoinformation services of the administration, in particular between the 
federal government, cantons, and municipalities. End users will thus have 
central access to homogeneous, comprehensive, and complete geodata that 
represents the current status. This will strengthen the use of official 
geoinformation in digital administrative processes.

Among other things, the concept suggests seven central properties for elementary 
geodata and a prioritization of data themes. 

It was developed by a working group comprising various stakeholders and has 
undergone a technical consultation, followed by further refinement based on the 
collected feedback.
