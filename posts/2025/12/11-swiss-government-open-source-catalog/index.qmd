Article 9 of the *Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means to Carry Out 
Official Tasks*[^abbr] requires Swiss federal authorities to publish the source 
code of software they develop or commission for the performance of their work.[^art9] 

The Federal Chancellery hosts the [Swiss Federal OSS](https://www.opensource.admin.ch/)[^oss][ Catalog](https://www.opensource.admin.ch/). It comprises 
"the software developed by the federal authorities and published as open source 
since 1 January 2024" (that is, the date of the enactment of the EMOTA).

As of writing, the OSS Catalog contains links to 60 OSS repositories. Note 
that, per the Federal Chancellery, "[e]ach authority is responsible for 
publishing its own source code", so this collection may reflect an initial 
effort and may (very well) not be complete.

Unfortunately, the catalog currently only allows search by the name of the 
organizational unit and the software, which limits the usefulness of the search. 

Quite a number of repositories are part of "swiyu" (a digital identity 
solution) and of a collection of "jEAP" (Java Enterprise Application Platform) 
tools. In order to find geo-related OSS, look for "Federal Office of 
Topography", the Swiss NMA[^nma] better known as "swisstopo". Currently, this 
search only yields the 
"[`STAC API`](https://www.opensource.admin.ch/softwares/37a4b856-cf16-436f-84a6-c7379e7ad0b3/)" 
of swisstopo. Perusing the OSS catalog, I additionally found 
"[`KADAS Albireo`](https://www.opensource.admin.ch/softwares/6b6b8923-2d4a-404b-bed3-ccb69daeea11/)", 
a QGIS-based [mapping application](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/map-display-system-of-the-armed-forces) for the 
[Swiss Armed Forces](https://ld.admin.ch/office/IV.1.4). 

A start towards digital sovereignty. Hopefully, the list grows longer.

German and "[LMETA](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2023/682/fr)" in French.

[^art9]: Article 9 states (auto-translated): 
(1) The federal authorities subject to this act shall disclose the source code 
of software that they develop or have developed for the performance of their 
tasks, unless the rights of third parties or security-related reasons would 
preclude or restrict this.
(2) They shall allow any person to use, further develop, and distribute the 
software and shall not charge any license fees.
(3) The rights under paragraph 2 shall be granted in the form of private law 
licenses, unless other enactments stipulate otherwise. Disputes between 
licensors and licensees shall be settled under civil law.
(4) Where possible and appropriate, internationally established license texts 
shall be used. Liability claims by licensees shall be excluded to the extent 
legally possible.
(5) The federal authorities subject to this act may provide supplementary 
services, in particular for integration, maintenance, ensuring information 
security, and support, provided that the services serve to fulfill official 
tasks and can be provided at reasonable expense.
(6) They shall charge a fee that covers the costs of the supplementary services. 
The competent department may allow exceptions for certain services if this does 
not compete with the private sector.
