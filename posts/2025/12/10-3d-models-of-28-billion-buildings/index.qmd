A research team from TUM^[Technical University Munich, Germany] led by Prof. 
Xiao Xiang Zhu has published a 3D dataset comprising 2.8 billion buildings 
world-wide. From [the announcement](https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/all-the-worlds-buildings-available-as-3d-models-for-the-first-time):

> How many buildings are there on Earth – and what do they look like in 3D? The 
research team led by Prof. Xiaoxiang Zhu, holder of the Chair of Data Science 
in Earth Observation at TUM, has answered these fundamental questions in this 
project funded by an ERC Starting Grant. 
>
> The GlobalBuildingAtlas comprises 2.75 billion building models, covering all 
structures captured in satellite imagery from the year 2019. This makes it the 
most comprehensive collection of its kind. For comparison: the largest previous 
global dataset contained about 1.7 billion buildings. The 3D models with a 
resolution of 3×3 meters are 30 times finer than data from comparable databases.

The GlobalBuildingAtlas data comes in two types: a digital surface model (DSM) 
at 3 meters resolution. Secondly, almost all buildings (97%) are also provided 
as vector data at LOD1[^lod1].

The TUM team used a ML^[Machine learning]-based approach to extract building 
footprint polygons and building heights^[Apparently, using a method called 
"monocular height estimation model", that is the model estimateds building 
height from a single image, not stereometrically] from 
[PlanetScope satellite data](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/planetscope)[^planetscope]. 
Data fusion with existing openly available building polygons[^sources] was also 
applied. RMSE[^rmse] of building height is reported to range from 1.5 meters 
to 8.9 meters.

[^lod1]: [Level-of-detail 1](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/lod/), meaning the model 
captures the shape of the building footprint and the building height, but not, 
for example, roof shape.
[^planetscope]: [PlanetScope](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/planetscope) 
is an ESA (European Space Agency) constellation of over 400 small satellites 
("cube sats") with three or four bands (optical to near-infrared) and roughly 
3 meters spatial resolution orbiting roughly 500 km above the Earth surface 
offering a daily revisit time at nadir.
[^sources]: The 
[Data description paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/6647/2025/) 
lists OpenStreetMap (OSM), Google Open Buildings, Microsoft Building 
Footprints, and CLSM as data sources.
[^rmse]: Root mean square error.
