[Air Loom](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html) is a side project by 
"[Objective Unclear](https://objectiveunclear.com/)" or 
[Benny Lim](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoCompetition2044/). The platform 
visualizes 
[ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast)[^adsb] 
data around international airports in a 3D view of the airspace. Users can view 
a 3D scene of the airport of interest and the positions and movements of 
aircraft in the airspace around it. Users have a wide array of functionality: 
You can, for example, search for an airport (using either 
[IATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_airport_code) or 
[ICAO airport codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_airport_code)), search 
for an individual aircraft, hide aircraft, filter aircraft by ID, type, and 
flight level, choose and tune many display options, do recordings, and more.

Some example airports: 

- [Geneva](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=GVA)
- [Basel-Mulhouse](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=BSL)
- [Zurich](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=ZRH)
- [Altenrhein](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=ACH)
- [Bern-Belp](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=BRN)
- [Sitten / Sion](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=SIR)
- [Locarno](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=LSZL)

And an extra-busy one for comparison: [Los Angeles LAX](https://objectiveunclear.com/airloom.html?airport=LAX)
