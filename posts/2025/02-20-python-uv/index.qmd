`uv` by Astral (also behind `Ruff`) is a new-*ish* Python project management 
tool that you may have already heard praise about. 
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) simplifies environment and dependency 
management for Python (truly, finally) and is blazingly fast, thus potentially 
streamlining also geospatial workflows reliant on libraries such as 
`GeoPandas`, `rasterio` and the like. 

If you use Python in your geospatial tooling, I highly recommend reading 
[this very level-headed and thorough one-year review of uv](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should) by *Bite Code!*

As to the name, [cf](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2479).
