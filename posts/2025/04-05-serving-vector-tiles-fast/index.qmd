Once you have [created your vector tiles](../04-04-tool-tip-tippecanoe-command-generator/), typically you look for a solution to serve them to clients. From [Fabian Rechsteiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabian-rechsteiner/) comes an interesting speed comparison of open-source solutions[^occasion]: ["Performance comparison of open source vector tiles server solutions for providing geodata from PostGIS databases"](https://github.com/FabianRechsteiner/vector-tiles-benchmark). The GitHub repo highlights speed comparisons between six vector tile servers across different tests:

- BBOX
- ldproxy
- Martin
- pg_tileserv
- Tegola
- TiPg

Besides the [statistics in the benchmark repository](https://github.com/FabianRechsteiner/vector-tiles-benchmark), Fabian Rechsteiner has published an eye-opening interactive side-by-side comparison of the six vector tile servers using a MapLibre client and data from the canton of Thurgau at <https://vectormap.ch>:

[Fabian Rechsteiner's benchmark repository](https://github.com/FabianRechsteiner/vector-tiles-benchmark) contains the code to roll your own tests (or maybe update his results a few months down the road). These insights are the results of his [Master's thesis](https://unigis.at/files/Mastertheses/Full/107112.pdf) at the University of Salzburg, which is also [publicly available (pdf, in German)](https://unigis.at/files/Mastertheses/Full/107112.pdf). If you have a subscription, you can also read a shorter [article on the analysis in Geomatik Schweiz, edition 11-12/2024](https://geomatik.ch) (paywalled, in German).

[^occasion]: I was reminded of this speed benchmark, specifically of an article about it in Geomatik Schweiz, by a [comment from Xavier Mérour](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313906270539792386?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7313906270539792386%2C7313955020389974016%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287313955020389974016%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7313906270539792386%29) (merci!).

Obviously, speed isn't the only quality dimension to decide on a vector tile server. But it is certainly an important one.
