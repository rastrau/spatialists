From [cartographer Andy Skinner](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/bb764e62afe74da7a0e5841068b14473) comes [this very useful resource about cartographic labeling](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/66414c82f2f34db0885c9b5553f4f024) for both interactive and static maps. While this guide comes in the form of an ArcGIS storymap, it is software-agnostic.

Scale, transparency-and-opacity, hue, tone, halos, ... – this guide covers many different visual variables and how they can be used, on their own or together, to make a map a lot more aesthetic *and* the information it contains easier to grasp.

The labeling guide is part of a six-part^[for now (?)] series in which Andy Skinner looks at his work. The other parts are listed at the bottom of the page.
