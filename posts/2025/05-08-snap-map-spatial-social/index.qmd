Spatial social^[I just made up this term, 
I [*think*](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/)] – Apparently, 
Snapchat, like other social media companies, has been exploring geospatial 
use-cases. From [TechCrunch (which also compiles a few more examples of spatial 
social)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/):

> Snapchat announced on Wednesday that Snap Map now has more than 400 million 
monthly active users[^MAU], a new milestone for one of the app’s core features. (...) 
[The Snapchat feature] now offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and 
find things to do. (...)

And:

> Last year, the company launched a "Footsteps" feature that lets you see how 
much of the world you’ve explored and track where you’ve traveled. Plus, 
Snapchat rolled out "Promoted Places" on Snap Map as a way for users to 
discover new places. For brands, Promoted Places offers the ability to 
advertise and showcase all of their locations on Snap Map.

For – admittedly slightly oblique – comparison: [In 2023](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/swisstopo-in-zahlen), 
map.geo.admin.ch recorded approximately 2 million monthly *visits*. Thus, 
presumably: Quite a bit fewer users. But of course, of exclusively people with 
interest in Switzerland.

[^MAU]: [Monthly active users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users), 
often "MAUs", are a key software performance metric.
