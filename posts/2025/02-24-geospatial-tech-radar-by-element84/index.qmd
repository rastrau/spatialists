Tech Radars originated as a way for technology-driven organizations to assess and communicate emerging trends. ThoughtWorks popularized the concept in 2010 with their Technology Radar, a periodic report categorizing technologies into "Adopt", "Trial", "Assess", and "Hold" to guide decision-making.

The format has since been adopted by other companies, including [Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/) and Spotify, often customized for internal use.

I recently came across the [Geospatial Tech Radar](https://element84.com/geospatial-tech-radar-24/#) by [Element 84](https://element84.com/). I recommend exploring this one, as it is well-executed from both a content and design/UI perspective.

PS: There is a Swiss variation of a geospatial tech radar called [GIS Trends](https://gistrends.ch) by SOGI (only available in German). However, it has a different focus and level of depth.
