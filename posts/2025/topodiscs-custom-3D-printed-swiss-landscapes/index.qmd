A new (currently, beta) service from [Stephan Heuel](https://blog.heuel.org/), 
<https://topoprint.ch> offers an innovative way to interact with Switzerland's 
topography. By combining high-resolution Swisstopo datasets with 3D printing 
technology, users can create detailed, tangible models – Topodiscs – of any 
location in Switzerland. 

Topodiscs are compact, 3D-printable models that represent terrain, buildings, 
and infrastructure within a defined radius. Users can choose locations by 
address or CH1903+ LV95 / EPSG:2056 coordinates through either Mastodon or 
Telegram and receive an STL file for 3D printing (adding a 3D-print-on-demand 
service is on the roadmap).
