In a recent video, [Hans van der Kwast](https://www.qwast-gis.com/), Associate Professor of Open Science and Digital Innovation, covers "[Digital sovereignty and open-source software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u6tPM-USHY)". 

In 30 minutes, Hans defines and explores sovereignty as it pertains to digital goods and services and how it interacts with international jurisdiction. He highlights the potential of open-source software for empowering users, be it individuals, communities, governments, or enterprises. At minute 13, the video looks at QGIS as a case study of the open-source model in the geospatial sector.

I found particularly interesting: 

- the discussion of the open-source value chain[^contributions] and monetization (starting at 15:50), 
- the discussion of two paths for commercial open-source – the solution-based model (starting at 17:30) and the productized SaaS^[Software as a Service] model (starting at 19:00)
- and the challenges for open-source in the procurement process (starting at 22:00).

[^contributions]: As a tangent to this video (and not focussed on geospatial), there is currently [an interesting discussion around the open-source multimedia tool `ffmpeg`](https://thenewstack.io/ffmpeg-to-google-fund-us-or-stop-sending-bugs/), the burden on open-source maintainers and the role and responsibilities of large tech companies benefitting from open-source software.
