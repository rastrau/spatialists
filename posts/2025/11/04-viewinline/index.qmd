Finally you can view your shapefiles in your terminal!^[/s] [`viewline`](https://github.com/nkeikon/inlineviewer) is a new Python-based and MIT-licensed utility by [Keiko Nomura](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/keiko-nomura-0231891_just-released-viewinline-for-those-using-activity-7390643680770023424-8Guu/) for iterm2^[A popular terminal app on Mac OS] and other terminals or CLIs^[Command line interfaces] that support inline display. Besides Shapefiles, [`viewinline`](https://github.com/nkeikon/inlineviewer) supports GeoPackages, TIFF and GeoJSON files. Very simple, very light-weight, and very non-interactive. But you can:

- ... view composite RGB rasters
- ... display individual raster bands and individual layers of GeoPackages
- ... apply specific color maps
- ... color vector data by column

and do a few more things. Here's a short demo by [the author](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/keiko-nomura-0231891_just-released-viewinline-for-those-using-activity-7390643680770023424-8Guu/):
