The [GeoHipster](https://www.geohipster.com/)[^transparency] calendar 2026 is 
announced and available to order. 
[Randal Hale](https://www.northrivergeographic.com/2026-geohipster-calendar/):

> Geohipster is one of those “side things” that’s been happening for over 10 
years now. Back in the dearly days of Twitter ... or I should call it the 
“Golden Age of social media”, Atanas Entchev had an idea to document the 
industry. So a handful of us post articles highlighting professionals in the 
industry AND – we have this calendar. The best part of the calendar is it’s 
maps made by people. Some are professional cartographers. Some aren’t. All are 
excellent and tell a story of some sort.

The calendar can [be ordered from lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/shop/randal-hale/geohipster-2026/paperback/product-7kjvdw6.html)^[Previews of all sheets are 
available]. It ships internationally and the proceeds help cover the costs of 
GeoHipster^[Tagline: "Mapping the world one organic vertex at a time"]:

> The money is used for everything from operating costs to anything else I can 
come up with. It pretty much breaks even each year.

The [call for calendar submissions](https://www.geohipster.com/2026-geohipster-calendar/) is usually open in fall. Watch 
[GeoHipster](https://www.geohipster.com) if you would like to contribute one of 
your maps in the future.
