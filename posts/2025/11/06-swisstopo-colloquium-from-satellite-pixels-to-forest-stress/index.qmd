On December 5, 10:00–11:30, swisstopo will host^[Exclusively on site, not online.] a colloquium focusing on a use case for high-resolution satellite data. The topic is _"[From Satellite Pixels to Forest Stress: swissEO Products for Real-time Environmental Monitoring](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/kolloquium-swisseo-produkte)"_. 

The colloquium will offer a look at an operational [EO product pipeline](https://deepwiki.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo) with the following characteristics:

* Products: Focus on [swissEO S2-SR](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/satellitenbilder-swisseo-s2-sr) (Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance^[The S2-SR product corrects for atmospheric effects, making the data useful for time series analysis and direct comparison.]) and [swissEO VHI](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/satellitenbilder-swisseo-vhi)^[VHI or Vegetation Health Index is a combination of Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI), often used for drought monitoring.].
* Backend: The [backend](https://github.com/swisstopo/topo-satromo) uses Google Earth Engine, Github Actions, and open-source software.
* Delivery: Cloud-native formats served via a STAC interface^[STAC stands for "SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog", a modern, open specification for cataloging spatiotemporal data.].
* Application: A collaboration between swisstopo, MeteoSwiss, and the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), the derived data is used in platforms like waldmonitoring.ch and TreeNet.
