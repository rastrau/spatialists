A few days ago, the Canton of Aargau unveiled its [new browser-based map viewer](https://www.ag.ch/geoportal/apps/onlinekarten) called "Online Karten":

Based on the available information, the new viewer appears to be built using [React](https://react.dev/) and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

The [old map viewer](https://www.ag.ch/app/agisviewer4/v1/agisviewer.html?) will remain accessible until August.
