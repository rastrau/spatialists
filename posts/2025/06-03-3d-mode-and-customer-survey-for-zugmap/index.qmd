ZugMap is the public map tool[^wording] of the [canton of Zug](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amt-f%C3%BCr-grundbuch-und-geoinformation). Today and 20 years after the first version of ZugMap, the canton of Zug [officially launched a newly developed 3D mode along with various 3D datasets](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amt-f%C3%BCr-grundbuch-und-geoinformation_workinprogress-zugmap-geodaten-activity-7335567776876494848-FAOu). 

At this point, [ZugMap 3D](https://zugmap.ch/3d) contains:

- 3D surface model
- 3D buildings and trees
- Points-of-interest (POIs) from Zug Tourismus
- Shaded relief including bathymetric (underwater) data
- VR^[Virtual reality] scenes thanks to a "Supermesh"^[Especially densely sampled 3D data] and indoor data capture
- Near-realtime display of IoT^[Internet of Things] data about air temperature and air humidity of the city of Zug

ZugMap 3D and the provision of 3D data are building blocks of the [cantonal geoinformation strategy](https://zg.ch/de/planen-bauen/geoinformation/geoinformationen-erklaert/kantonale-geoinformationsstrategie)[^transparency].

Interested people can [give ZugMap 3D a spin](https://zugmap.ch/3d). The canton is [conducting an (anonymous) user survey in order to find additional user needs as well as avenues for future development and improvement](https://umfrage.zg.ch/index.php/531998?lang=de).

[^wording]: "Public map tool" is the canton's wording, rather than, for example, "geoportal"; I suspect for approachability reasons (maybe wise).

[^transparency]: Transparency note: As you can see if you peruse the strategy documents, I (together with colleagues) have assisted the canton of Zug in the drafting of this strategy.
