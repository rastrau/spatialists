Yesterday, the Federal Government has launched a [new national platform to monitor draught 
risks](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en). The platform was jointly developed by the 
[Federal Office for the Environment](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home.html) (FOEN), 
[MeteoSwitzerland](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/#tab=forecast-map), and 
[Swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en). From the press release (in 
[German](https://www.news.admin.ch/de/newnsb/uM-Mc120LtpPl7uVuRkti), in 
[French](https://www.news.admin.ch/fr/newnsb/uM-Mc120LtpPl7uVuRkti)):

> The drought platform provides standardized information on the current drought situation in the 
various regions of Switzerland as well as forecasts for the next four weeks. Data on past events can 
also be retrieved. Existing monitoring networks and forecasting models have been supplemented with new 
information based on satellite data and long-term forecasts, e.g. for precipitation. Measurement data 
on soil moisture and water temperatures is also expected to be integrated from 2026.

There is also an introductory video in [German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZaa1EoL4Jk) and in 
[French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hy__fDMVpo) (translated subtitles available).

![In the [drill-down view](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/de/regionen/47-alpstein/aktuelle-lage), the National Drought Platform offers a lot of detail about the monitoring regions. Much more data is available beneath the "fold".](rhine-valley.png 'In the drill-down view, the National Drought Platform offers a lot of detail about the monitoring regions.

The [National Drought Platform](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en) offers data on: 

- [Combined Drought Index (CDI)](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/drought/drought-index)
- [Precipitation](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/factors/precipitation)
- [Rivers and lakes gauges](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/factors/water)
- [Soil moisture](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/factors/soil)
- [Vegetation](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/factors/vegetation)
- [Groundwater](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/factors/groundwater)

Particularly interesting for geospatial professionals: The state of the vegetation is based on the so-called [Vegetation Health Index](https://www.trockenheit.admin.ch/en/factors/vegetation/vegetation-health-index-vhi) (VHI) which is in turn based on analysis of remote sensing data.^[Transparency note: My employer has made a small contribution to the processing.]
