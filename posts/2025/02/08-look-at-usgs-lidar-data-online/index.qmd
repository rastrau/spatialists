At <https://usgs.entwine.io> you can peruse more than 2,000 
[USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/) [3D Elevation Program](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep) 
(3DEP) LiDAR datasets that have been made available through the 
[AWS Public Dataset Program](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/). 
The data amounts to 70,409,082,675,345 LiDAR points at the time of writing.

The datasets cover most of the USA and can be looked at *in the browser* using 
Potree-based or Cesium-based viewers. The data has been processed into the 
[Entwine Point Tile format](https://entwine.io/en/latest/entwine-point-tile.html) 
which combines JSON for metadata and LAZ for data for performance.
