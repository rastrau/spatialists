Quite a mouthful, that title: *"Road network disruptions during extreme 
flooding events and their impact on the access to emergency medical 
services: A spatiotemporal vulnerability analysis"*. From a Swiss-Austrian 
team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road 
network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding 
events affect the population's access to emergency medical services (EMS). 
The [paper is open-access](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177140).

It seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but 
certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due 
to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in 
accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a 
simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.

From the paper:

> In the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and 
cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective 
management of dynamic flood risk. (...) existing infrastructure was 
designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have 
been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high 
consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions 
by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood 
event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local 
context to reduce societal vulnerabilities.
