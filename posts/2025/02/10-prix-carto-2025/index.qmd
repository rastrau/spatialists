The [Swiss Society of Cartography](https://kartografie.ch) (Schweizerische 
Gesellschaft für Kartografie, SGK) is set to host the prestigious bi-annual 
Prix Carto awards during its autumn meeting in 2025. This event celebrates 
innovative and outstanding cartographic products with a connection to 
Switzerland. The award highlights excellence in cartography, geomatics, and 
geovisualization, offering recognition across multiple categories.

Besides its main category, the Prix Carto also includes two special awards to 
foster young talent: the "Prix Carto – start", aimed at school students and 
apprentices, and the "Prix Carto – edu", designed for university students and 
adults in training programs. Both of the "young talent" awards carry a prize of 
500 Swiss Francs.

[Submissions for the 2025 awards are now open](https://kartografie.ch/prix-carto/call-2025/), 
with participants required to submit their entries through an official form on 
the SGK website. The SGK encourages widespread participation from both seasoned 
professionals and emerging talents.
