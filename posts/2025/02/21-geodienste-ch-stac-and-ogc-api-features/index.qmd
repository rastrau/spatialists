[KGK-CGC](https://www.kgk-cgc.ch) published a new release (4.0.2) of their geoservices 
platform geodienste.ch. Notable excerpt from the 
[release notes](https://kgk-cgc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/guide/pages/2478637062/Changelog) 
under the item "Implement selected parts of [eCH-0056 v4.1.0](https://www.ech.ch/de/ech/ech-0056/4.0.1)"^[Anwendungsprofil Geodienste / Profil d’application des géoservices]: 

> Activate OGC API Features for all topics. 

> Introduce Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) for all topics.

While QGIS and its STAC API Browser Plugin shows me an error for the STAC at 
<https://geodienste.ch/stac>, it does pass validation with 
[STAC Lint](https://staclint.com) and works in 
[Rocket](https://rocket.snapplanet.io/map?c=0,0,2.5). 

Oddly, assets seem to be limited to XTF^[Interlis transfer format] files at the 
moment, although geodienste.ch offers other, more operative data formats 
outside of its STAC.
