... for I am not interested in the Shapefile Wars and I do not 
want to wake up the geospatial format zealots. But: By now, a 
cultural history of the Shapefile, the world's foremost 
geospatial data format^[much in the same way Excel is 
the world's foremost "database" – besides SQLite] since the 
early 1990s (!), would be warranted, such is its impact. James 
Fee's article "[Shapefile: The Persistent 
Legacy of a GIS Workhorse](https://jamesfee.org/2025/02/12/shapefile-the-persistent-legacy-of.html)" makes the point: 

> I’m pretty sure Esri never intended the Shapefile to be a 
long-term standard, its simplicity, compatibility, and widespread 
adoption have cemented its place in geospatial workflows across 
industries. (...) Even as more efficient, flexible, and robust 
alternatives like GeoJSON, Parquet, and GeoPackage have emerged, 
the Shapefile persists, often by necessity rather than preference.

Luckily, I don't usually have to cater to workflows that rely on 
Shapefiles at all^[One exception comes to mind: to my dismay, a 
popular traffic modelling software only supports Shapefile for 
GIS data exchange.]. 

As to alternatives, there are many to chose from. I find it hard 
to name "the best" data format, since it very much depends: 

- In what environment do you want to use spatial data?
- To what end: Is the main purpose storage or retrieval/analysis?
- How big is the data and of what nature is it? 
- Do you have to use certain software with maybe limited 
support for some formats? 
- Do you have to build upon given workflows? 
- etc. 
- etc.

I do find [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org) and 
[FlatGeoBuf](https://flatgeobuf.org) particulary interesting 
vector data formats, for some of my use cases – ymmv^[your mileage may vary], obviously.
