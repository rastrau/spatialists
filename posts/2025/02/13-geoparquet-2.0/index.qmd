On the heels of [this](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/02-12-the-format-that-shall-not-be-named/), news from the 
#cloudnative and #cloudnativegeo world: 

> The Parquet specification has officially adopted geospatial 
guidance, enabling native storage of `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` 
types

and 

> Iceberg 3 now includes `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` as part of its 
official specification

What does it mean? Well, `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` are now
native logical data types in both Apache Parquet^[an open-source, 
columnar storage file format designed for efficient data processing] 
and Apache Iceberg^[an open-source, high-performance table format 
for large datasets in data lakes], just like, e.g., `INT32` is. 
This is a big step for mainstreaming "geo" in the cloud-native^[i.e. 
taking full advantage of the cloud computing model; in the data world
typically through enabling [partial downloads](https://blog.sogeo.services/blog/2023/12/29/statuscode-206-letsgetstarted.html) of file contents 
through so-called [HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests)] 
data community. 

What's going to be even more interesting are the next steps in 
order to make the cloud-native paradigm work better for spatial data. 
The rough roadmap and more details are [available from CNG](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2025/02/geoparquet-2.0-going-native/).
