Switzerland has recently experienced an unusually dry period with minimal rainfall, causing water levels in Lake Constance to drop to a historic low â€” the lowest recorded in 40 years according to experts in the media. Having observed the situation firsthand recently, I decided to explore remote sensing and other data sources to better understand the current conditions and the potential risks of an impending drought. I shared [my findings online](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7314736416775626752/) yesterday, where they garnered significant interest, thus I decided to share them here as well (my apologies if you have seen them before).

Specifically, I briefly analyzed Sentinel-2 satellite data (true-color imagery and the Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI) from April 5<sup>th</sup>, combined with geodata from swisstopo's swissTLM<sup>3D</sup> and gauging data to assess the lake's extent and water levels:

![The *Untersee*, captured in Sentinel-2 true-color imagery (source: Copernicus/ESA), is shown here with a red outline indicating the typical shoreline of Lake Constance. While it is common for the water level to drop below the usual shoreline during winter, the extent of this recession is unusually pronounced this year.](untersee-true-color.jpg "The Untersee, captured in Sentinel-2 true-color imagery (source: Copernicus/ESA), is shown here with a red outline indicating the typical shoreline of Lake Constance.
