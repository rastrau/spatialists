More news from GeoParquet: Shortly after the Parquet format has adopted `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY` 
as native data types, 
[Chris Holmes shares](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/opencholmes_geoparquet-in-arcgis-pro-changed-to-in-product-activity-7301003561969098752-PzyT/?rcm=ACoAAAKAF2sB6NpMGZJlvdPm_PIKcIoxwyx5WEQ) 
that the status of a 
[petition for GeoParquet support in Esri ArcGIS Pro](https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-pro-ideas/geoparquet-support-in-arcgis-pro/idc-p/1590371) has [been changed to "In product plan"](https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-pro-ideas/geoparquet-support-in-arcgis-pro/idc-p/1590371#M33988). 
And apparently, [STAC support is also on Esri's roadmap](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7301003561969098752?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7301003561969098752%2C7301295634005831680%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287301295634005831680%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7301003561969098752%29).

This is good news for the #cloudnativegeo paradigm. [As noted previously](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/02-13-geoparquet-2.0/) 
regarding the native data types news:

> What’s going to be even more interesting are the next steps in order to make the cloud-native paradigm work better for spatial data. 

Crossing fingers that the GeoParquet support will arrive soon in the Esri software ecosystem and 
will offer users the full capabilities of the format.
