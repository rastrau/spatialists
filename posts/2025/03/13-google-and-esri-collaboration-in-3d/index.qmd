Google and Esri have agreed on a collaboration that will bring photorealistic 3D data from Google Maps into the ArcGIS ecosystem, starting in fall. The Google Maps data covers 2,500 cities in around 50 countries. Technologically, this collaboration leverages the [OGC community standard "3D Tiles"](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/3dtiles/).
