In my experience, early career geospatial professionals often, geo-adjacent professionals virtually always, struggle with coordinate reference systems (CRSs). Who can blame them: CRSs can be confusing from a theoretical perspective, and handling them in your day-to-day GIS workflows even more so.

In comes [ihatecoordinatesystems.com](https://ihatecoordinatesystems.com) by Dan Mahr: While the naming is *very on the nose*, this website provides an invaluable service. Structured around 12 common frustrations and questions, it serves as a refreshingly practical problem-solving guide for CRS issues.

Items include, for example (the actual section headings add the emphatic *"I hate coordinate systems!"* ðŸ˜ƒ):

- [My dataset is off the coast of Africa!](https://ihatecoordinatesystems.com/#null-island) â€” hint: Null Island
- [My dataset is not located where it should be!](https://ihatecoordinatesystems.com/#wrong-crs)
- [My dataset is slightly offset from where it should be!](https://ihatecoordinatesystems.com/#wrong-gcs)

For Switzerland, maybe we should add *"My dataset seems to be located in eastern Europe / in the Atlantic off the coast of France"* and *"My dataset has Switzerland in portrait rather than landscape mode"*...

The site offers another exceptional feature: if your dataset has an incorrect CRS specified, [you can enter](https://ihatecoordinatesystems.com/#correct-crs) an approximate latitude and longitude along with the corresponding X and Y coordinates from your dataset, and ihatecoordinatesystems.com will attempt to identify the correct CRS! Needless to say, this functionality can save your day.
