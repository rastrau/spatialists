[From David O'Sullivan](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-05-02-tiles-and-glyphs/tiles-and-glyphs.html)[^O'Sullivan], self-described geospatial "problem solver, researcher, 
analyst, communicator, and trainer":

> In this post I look at a relatively simple example of [the problem of presenting 
complex multivariate data in single map views] (...) I’m deliberately not going to 
say what the data represent. Suffice to say we have three variables, shown below 
for a chunk of New Zealand. From left to right, these are a resource potentially 
at risk, and two risk factors.

David O'Sullivan [walks us through various considerations and design alternatives 
to show the afore-mentioned data in a single map](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-05-02-tiles-and-glyphs/tiles-and-glyphs.html): tile maps using tilings of 
squares and other shapes, glyph maps, tile maps with diagrams, and a tile map 
combined with the *value-by-alpha* method popularized by Rob Roth[^RobRoth], for example.

In this article, I also learned about 
[MapWeaver](https://dosull.github.io/mapweaver/app/), a software that allows you 
to conduct your own experiments with various tiling schemes, and the underlying 
[Python package `weavingspace`](https://github.com/DOSull/weaving-space).

I *love* the out-of-the-box experimentation of [this article](https://dosull.github.io/posts/2025-05-02-tiles-and-glyphs/tiles-and-glyphs.html) and the more 
avant-garde approaches that challenge traditional visualization methods offered 
by your run-off-the-mill GIS software. More of this, please.

[^O'Sullivan]: "O'Sullivan" in GIS... – Wait, what is this bell going off in my head? 
I was very pleased to realize that I was looking at the website of the O'Sullivan 
of "O'Sullivan and Unwin (2003)" (or 2010, 2nd ed.). This is [my all-time favorite 
book on GIS and spatial analyis](https://dosull.github.io/books.html).

[^RobRoth]: See [here](https://andywoodruff.com/blog/value-by-alpha-maps/), for example.
