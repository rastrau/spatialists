Yesterday, the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) launched vector tiles on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) website <https://openstreetmap.org>:

> Now, with integration of the vector tiles as a feature layer on the OpenStreetMap website, mappers and visitors get a visual layer that is sharper and quicker, based on an entirely new backend.

In my tests, the new vector tyles were not the default map (yet?). You can see them by choosing the "Shortbread" map style in the menu on the right – or by clicking [this link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/46.472/8.734&layers=S).

The tiles use the [Shortbread](https://shortbread-tiles.org/) vector tile schema, and [Tilekiln](https://github.com/pnorman/tilekiln) is used for generating the map tiles in the MVT^[Mapbox Vector Tiles] format. 

Developers can create their own map styles and use the tiles hosted by the OSMF. Of course, fair usage rules apply, as detailed in the [Vector Tile Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/vector/).

Further details can be found in [the announcement on the OSM blog](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2025/07/22/vector-tiles-are-deployed-on-openstreetmap-org/).
