On August 26, [Stefan Keller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-keller-44785a10) of FH OST will host a free [webinar on (geo)data manipulation and integration using Apache Hop](https://www.geowebforum.ch/t/webinar-ki-gestuetzte-enterprise-und-geo-datenintegration-und-apache-hop-26-08-2025-11-12-uhr/1185). 

[Apache Hop](https://hop.apache.org)^["Hop" stands for "Hop Orchestration Platform"; the [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) maybe being a nod to "GNU"?] is an open-source platform (under the Apache v2 license) that – in its own words and certainly in the hopes of some industry stakeholders – "aims to be the future of data integration." And: "Hop workflows and pipelines are definitions of how data needs to be processed. Once designed, a pipeline can be executed on any supported runtime. Hop has built-in support to run pipelines locally and remotely in the native Hop runtime, or on Apache Spark, Apache Flink or Google Dataflow through the Apache Beam runtimes." 

Similar to the market leader in this space^[I think...] FME^[Safe Software's Feature Manipulation Engine], Hop workflows are created through a graphical user interface using the drag-and-drop method. Meaning: Hop is a no-code or low-code solution for crafting data workflows.

Besides Apache Hop, the [webinar](https://www.giswiki.ch/KI-gestützte_Enterprise-_und_Geo-Datenintegration_und_Apache_Hop_2025-08) will cover some recent developments around AI^[Artificial intelligence] and LLMs^[Large Language Models] in data integration. [Registration is required](https://www.giswiki.ch/KI-gestützte_Enterprise-_und_Geo-Datenintegration_und_Apache_Hop_2025-08).
