The Fediverse bot [FediFollows](https://social.growyourown.services/@FediFollows) 
published a [list of recommended geospatial Fediverse 
accounts](https://social.growyourown.services/@FediFollows/114785370032906119). 
The [list](https://social.growyourown.services/@FediFollows/114785370032906119) 
features, among others, geospatial conferences, news channels, blogs, software, 
organizations, government bodies, geospatial professionals, OSM-related 
accounts, and discussion groups.

You can follow these accounts from any 
[Fediverse](https://fedi.tips/what-is-mastodon-what-is-the-fediverse/) 
instance, for example, from a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) account, or 
you can consume them via RSS[^rss]: Appending `.rss` to the 
URL of any Fediverse account yields an RSS feed. For example, for the 
Spatialists account: 

- the Mastodon account URL is <https://mapstodon.space/@spatialists>
- the corresponding RSS feed is at <https://mapstodon.space/@spatialists.rss>

Why does this matter? &mdash; Three years^[Give or take.] after the implosion of 
their community on Twitter, part of the geospatial industry is still feeling 
phantom pain: It certainly feels like there is no equivalent to 
Twitter-of-the-2010s for connecting and sharing knowledge and opinions on 
geospatial topics.[^alternatives] There is some hope, the Fediverse may fill 
part of this void.

Other than the [RSS feed](https://spatialists.ch/follow.html) and the 
[newsletter](https://spatialists.ch/subscribe.html), this site uses 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spatialists) and the 
[Fediverse (Mastodon)](https://mapstodon.space/@spatialists) to broadcast its 
news.

[^rss]: "Rich Site Summary", "Really Simple Syndication", and/or "RDF Site 
Summary", [over time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). This site hosts a 
[quick intro](https://spatialists.ch/follow.html).
[^alternatives]: Sure, there are: Threads, Bluesky, 
[Slack](https://thespatialcommunity.org/), Discord, 
[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/gis), LinkedIn etc. But none of these has the 
culture and mechanisms Twitter had. All have essentially the same frail 
business model and lopsided incentives, though.
