A group of eleven participants[^eleven] from the 2025 NORTH51[^north51] 
conference have published a 
[manifesto for the geospatial industry](https://www.n51.ca/blog/geofesto)[^manifesto]. 
The authors' motivation and ambition are stated as follows (emphasis mine):

> Every headline now has a latitude and longitude. Wildfires darken skies half 
a continent away, supply chains reroute in hours, and satellite images expose 
current events before diplomats can draft statements. In this high-velocity 
world, whoever understands "where" outpaces the competition, protects 
communities, and shapes policy. 
> 
> Geospatial is no longer a specialist’s hobby; it is a critical input to 
decision-making. This document, a "GEOFESTO," **lays out the principles and 
emerging trends that let practitioners ride the wave instead of drowning 
beneath it**.

The group proposes the following five principles:

- **Educate to make spatial literacy universal**

- **Choose collaboration over silos**

- **Commit to open standards**

- **Geospatial as an approach, not a solution**

- **Obsess over outcomes**

Much more is explored in the [manifesto](https://www.n51.ca/blog/geofesto).

I am convinced that manifestos (as well as strategies) – and even more so, 
the discussions they spark – can truly drive change and help achieve goals 
that go beyond everyday business.[^manifestos] 

I wonder what should be included in a manifesto for the geospatial industry in 
Switzerland in 2025.

[^north51]: NORTH51 is an annual conference in Canada, a 
[self-described](https://www.n51.ca/who-we-are) "dynamic gathering that 
embodies the spirit of modernization in the geospatial industry (...) [uniting] 
entrepreneurs passionate about bringing a platform to the industry to share 
grand, global, market-changing ideas."

[^manifesto]: They call it "GEOFESTO", thankfully with a self-aware irony: 
"Paying homage to our community’s insistence on adding the prefix “geo” to 
almost any word. (...)"

[^manifestos]: Hence, I have written or co-written some manifestos myself, for 
example the [GeoBeer Manifesto](https://geobeer.ch/manifesto.html) (2013), the 
[Data Worker's Manifesto](https://digital.ebp.ch/2014/09/19/the-data-workers-manifesto/) 
(2014), and "[Connecting the Dots](https://digital.ebp.ch/2024/10/20/schweizer-geoinformation-2024-connecting-the-dots-perpetual-beta/)" (2024).
