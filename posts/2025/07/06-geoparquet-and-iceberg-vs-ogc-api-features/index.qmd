[Ingo Simonis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingosimonis/), Chief Technology Innovation Officer at [OGC](https://www.ogc.org), has published an article asking the question "[Does GeoParquet Replace OGC API-Features?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/does-geoparquet-replace-ogc-api-features-ingo-simonis-oaiee/)". It's an interesting short read that positions GeoParquet (and Apache Iceberg) vis-à-vis OGC API-Features (the successor of WFS 2.0):

> In practice, you might store data as GeoParquet files managed through 
> Apache Iceberg, performing large-scale analytics and incremental updates
> directly. Then, leverage OGC API-Features to serve dynamic spatial subsets,
> historical queries, or real-time integrations from Iceberg tables.
