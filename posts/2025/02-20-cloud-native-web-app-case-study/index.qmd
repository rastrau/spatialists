From [Stephan Heuel](https://blog.heuel.org) comes a very interesting case 
study that explores the possibilies of web apps based on the 
"[cloud-native geo](https://cloudnativegeo.org)" paradigm: The ["Swiss Rooftop 
Explorer" project](https://blog.heuel.org/2025/02/swiss-roof-explorer/) 
demonstrates a cloud-native approach to accessing and visualizing geospatial 
data, specifically roof heights of buildings in Switzerland based on 
swisstopo's swissBUILDINGS<sup>3D</sup> dataset.

Instead of relying on traditional GIS server architecture and infrastructure , 
the project leverages GeoParquet, DuckDB, Tippecanoe, PMTiles, and DuckDB-WASM 
for efficient data processing, storage and delivery. The toolchain is [entirely 
open](https://github.com/ping13/swiss-rooftop-explorer) and in 
[his blog post](https://blog.heuel.org/2025/02/swiss-roof-explorer/), 
Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional 
GIS tech stack:

> (...) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The 
current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a 
heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them 
entirely while the user experience is the same!

*The* source for learning more about the "cloud-native geo" paradigm is of course 
the [Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum](https://cloudnativegeo.org).

In the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats 
e.g. under the [swissEO product line](https://data.geo.admin.ch/browser/index.html#/collections/ch.swisstopo.swisseo_s2-sr_v100?.language=en) (cf. also 
[here](https://geomatik.ch/swisstopo-swisseo-produktreihe-near-realtime-satellitendaten-fuers-trockenheitsmonitoring-und-weitere-anwendung/) for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the 
"cloud-native geo" paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a 
GeoStandards.ch-issued [whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch](https://www.opengis.ch/2024/04/09/cloud-optimized-geospatial-formats/), in the 
[digital.ebp.ch blog](https://digital.ebp.ch/category/cloud-native/) and of 
course [here](../02-13-geoparquet-2.0), so far.
