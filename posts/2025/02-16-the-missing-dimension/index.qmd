A bold statement from Will Cadell in his recent article 
[Time for a Change](https://www.strategicgeospatial.com/p/time-for-a-change). 
While Earth observation has always been about detecting change, Cadell argues 
that the industry still struggles to treat time as a structured and fundamental 
dimension.

The gap: Geospatial tools remain rooted in static, two-dimensional thinking. 
Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly 
integrating time into analysis. 

How to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D 
visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical 
representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping 
it. Cadell again:

> "Measuring geography through time often means we lose the geographical 
representation, but that’s ok!"

This shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster 
response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where 
things are – it’s about how and why they change.

Perhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, 
time-driven insights – think dashboards^[But be aware of the dashboard trap:
