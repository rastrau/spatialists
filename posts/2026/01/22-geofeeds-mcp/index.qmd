[GeoFeeds](https://geofeeds.me/view) is a (non-curated) aggregator of feeds of 
around 90 geospatial or geospatial-adjacent blogs[^add], operated by 
[Bill Dollins](https://bsky.app/profile/geobabbler.bsky.social) and 
[James Fee](https://bsky.app/profile/jamesfee.bsky.social). Recently, Bill set 
up an MCP[^mcp] endpoint for GeoFeeds. MCP is a way for AI systems to communicate 
with external tools and data sources using a common "language" instead of 
needing custom code for each connection. This MCP endpoints can now be used 
to analyze the cached feed using AI clients. Bill's blog has more [background 
and some examples](https://blog.geomusings.com/2026/01/20/geofeeds-now-with-mcp/): 

> For example, I asked Claude to tell me the most prolific blogs so far this 
month (January, 2026). I spot checked a few of these and the numbers were 
right. (It also correctly flagged OSGeo’s spam problem.)

I'm not sure how large the GeoFeeds cache (and thus the accessible volume of 
"data") is. But in any case this is something interesting to play around with. 

[^add]: I added Spatialists [back in May](https://github.com/geobabbler/neptune/issues/9). You can submit feeds to be included by opening an issue in the 
[GeoFeeds repository](https://github.com/geobabbler/neptune).
