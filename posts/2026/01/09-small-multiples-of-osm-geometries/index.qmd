This open-source tool lets you explore and compare OSM geometries – from quirky lakes to oddly shaped museums – arranged as small multiples based on any #Overpass query you create."

A bit of fun: [Matt Whilden](https://en.osm.town/@watmildon), president of the 
OSM US Board of Directors, hosts the 
[XofY OSM Geometry Viewer](https://watmildon.github.io/XofY/). The clue is in 
the name: Using this tool, you can view, arranged as small multiples, the 
geometries of OSM features of type X in area Y. Or in Matt's words:

> Explore the geometry of sets of features in the OpenStreetMap database. Find a funky lake. Marvel at unusual museums. Add detail to boring geometry. Let me know if you find something fun. :-)

You can enter your own queries in Overpass QL^[Query Language]. The 
[tool](https://watmildon.github.io/XofY/) also offers example queries, see 
below. The tool is [open-source](https://github.com/watmildon/XofY).
