Today, the Sentinel-2 earth observation mission[^sentinel] has three identical 
satellites in orbit: Sentinel-2A (launched in 2015), Sentinel-2B (launched in 
2017; with its Sun-synchronous orbit phased at 180° with respect to 
Sentinel-2A's[^shortening]), and Sentinel-2C (launched in 2024).

Sentinel-2C is meant to replace 2A, Sentinel-2D (yet to be launched) will 
eventually replace 2B. Later, the Sentinel-2 Next Generation Mission is planned 
to ensure Sentinel data continuity beyond 2035.

Now for the really interesting part: Since Sentinel-2C is operational and 
Sentinel-2A still works, ESA is currently using the latter to explore imaging 
the Earth at night. From the [press release](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2/Sentinel-2_explores_night_vision): 

> (...) the [largely optical] satellites experience darkness during night-time 
passes. Under normal operations, the imagers are switched off when the 
satellites passes over night-shrouded parts of the planet. (...) the current 
generation of Sentinel-2 satellites (...) were never designed to image at night 
(...).
> 
> As Sentinel-2A approaches the end of its operational life, it continues to 
support the operational Sentinel-2 mission – but, in addition, engineers and 
scientists are using some of its remaining time in orbit to test new ideas for 
the future and to prepare for the Next Generation mission. One such experiment 
has been to see how it would fare when switching it on at night. [And] it did 
remarkably well.

The [results](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2/Sentinel-2_explores_night_vision) are visually interesting and hopefully 
valuable for both research and for engineering future Earth observation sensors 
and platforms.

These tests are possible, because Sentinel-2A (like some sibling 
satellites[^longlife]) has managed to outlive its planned duration of operation 
and because, thus, its replacement is already in orbit and operational. At the 
time of writing, the Sentinel-2A numbers are, per 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-2A):

> Mission duration:<br>
> Planned: 7 years<br>
> Elapsed: 10 years, 6 months, 23 days

What a great machine. Go 2A!

[^sentinel]: [Sentinel-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-2) is a 
satellite remote sensing mission in the European 
[Copernicus Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Programme). 
[^shortening]: This is done to shorten the revisit time (the timespan it takes 
to capture the same parth of the Earth's surface again) between the two 
identical satellites from 10 days to 5 days.
[^longlife]: As an extreme (probably the most extreme?) example, 
[Landsat 5](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/landsat-5/) comes to mind: 
Launched in 1984, planned operation until 1987, decommissioned in 2013 (!). 
What feat of engineering!
