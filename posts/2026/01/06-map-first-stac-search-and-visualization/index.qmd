description: "#DevelopmentSeed has released #stacmap, an #opensource, map-first visualizer for exploring and searching #STAC collections through a simple, browser-based interface. It already supports natural-language queries (albeit experimentally) and also stac-#geoparquet."

It's been under development for some months, but I have taken note only in 
December: The folks at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) work on 
[`stac-map`](https://github.com/developmentseed/stac-map), a "map-first, 
single-page, statically-hosted STAC visualizer". 

The tool enables users to visualize and search the content of a STAC[^stac]. 
The search functionality supports natural language input and works on STAC 
collections. It's designated "experimental" and potentially "rather slow", at 
the time of writing. `stac-map` also supports 
[`stac-geoparquet`](https://stac-utils.github.io/stac-geoparquet/latest/).

`stac-map` is [open-source](https://github.com/developmentseed/stac-map) under 
the MIT license. Development Seed offers a demo page at 
[developmentseed.org/stac-map](https://developmentseed.org/stac-map/). For a 
test, I plugged in the STAC of the FSDI[^fsdi], 
[data.geo.admin.ch/api/stac/v1](https://data.geo.admin.ch/api/stac/v1/). You 
can examine 
[the result here](https://developmentseed.org/stac-map/?href=https://data.geo.admin.ch/api/stac/v1/).
