Fresh from the SGS board[^sgsboard]: The Swiss Geoinformation Strategy (SGS) 
action plan for the year 2026 has just been published, after formal approval by the 
[Coordinating Agency for federal geographical information, GCG](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/organisation-names-departments-contacts) (GKG / GCS in German and French, 
respectively), and the [Conference of the Cantonal Geoinformation and Cadastral 
Offices](https://www.kgk-cgc.ch) (KGK / CGC). 

The action plan is available 
[in German](https://www.geoinformation.ch/de/jaehrlicher-aktionsplan) and 
[in French](https://www.geoinformation.ch/fr/plan-daction).

The action plan adopts new actions in the following SGS domains:

- Fostering the Geoinformation Ecosystem: 1 new action
- Linking Geodata: 1 new action
- Simplifying Processes: 1 new action
- Fostering Innovation: : 3 new actions
- Building and Strengthening Skills: 1 new action
- Enhancing Digital Platforms: 1 new action

Maybe surprisingly, no new actions, like in 2025 already, are adopted for the SGS domains "Development of Geodata Science".

[^sgsboard]: The organisation tasked with strategic oversight and steering of 
the implementation of the [Swiss Geoinformation Strategy](https://www.geo.admin.ch/de/strategie-und-umsetzung).
