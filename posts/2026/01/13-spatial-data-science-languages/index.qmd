From a distinguished team of authors comes a JOSIS[^josis] publication: 
*"[Spatial data science languages: commonalities and 
needs](https://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/view/462)"*. In it, 
the group comprising Edzer Pebesma[^edzer], Martin Fleischmann[^martin] and several 
more researchers make the argument that common challenges should be considered 
across language communities for spatial data science (SDS). The paper focuses on R, 
Python and Julia – especially popular SDS languages.

The identified common challenges include: 

- handling of spatial or spatio-temporal support
- geodetic coordinates
- in-memory vector data formats
- data cubes
- trajectories
- inter-package dependencies
- packaging upstream libraries
- differences in habits or conventions between the GIS and physical modeling communities
- statistical models

If any of these topics are relevant to you, you may enjoy reading the thoughts 
in the paper.

I especially appreciated some of the conclusion and 
recommendations, for example:

> It is encouraging to see that involvement in the development of open 
geospatial is no longer restricted to members of the Open Geospatial Consortium 
(OGC), and takes place in issues of public OGC GitHub repositories (for 
instance for GeoZarr and GeoParquet), or even completely outside OGC 
communication channels (e.g. STAC, GDAL, and openEO). (...)

> The increased diversity in data frame libraries, increased diversity in 
geospatial tooling, and increasing data size have highlighted a need for 
connectivity that extends beyond the columnar memory model (...). Wider 
adoption of GeoParquet as a more efficient file format for whole-fileread / 
write and wider adoption of GeoArrow as a common metadata standard and memory 
model may help address these challenges. (...)

and

> One of the findings from the SDSL sessions is that cross-language 
infrastructure is in its infancy. (...). We recommend that more work is done to 
provide both the technical infrastructure and social environments for 
constructive cross-language work for spatial data science developers, users and 
educators.
