Today, the first stable version (Long-Term Release, LTR) of GeoGirafe was 
published. From the 
[announcement](https://geogirafe.org/geogirafe-1-0-release-is-out/): 

> After an active development phase and a promising Release Candidate, we are 
pleased to announce the release of GeoGirafe 1.0. With this first LTR release, 
GeoGirafe reaches an important milestone and establishes itself as a 
structuring open-source project within the geospatial ecosystem. 

GeoGirafe is a self-described "ecosystem of WebGIS components" that can be 
combined with different backend infrastructure. It offers, at its core, a web 
map viewer comprising OGC^[Open Geospatial Consortium]-services display, 
authentication, search, filtering, measurement, drawing, and sharing tools as 
well as a 3D mode. If you want to learn more, [demo instances](https://geogirafe.org/demo/) are available.
