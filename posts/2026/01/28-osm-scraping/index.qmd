description: "An #OpenStreetMap-themed account on LinkedIn is calling on journalists to investigate a surge in what seems to be coordinated #scraping from hundreds of thousands of IP addresses, suspected to be linked to #AI #data collection. This incident spotlights growing tension between #opendata principles and the potential for misuse of public infrastructure."

Yesterday, an OpenStreetMap-themed account on 
LinkedIn[^osmaccount] [has reached out](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-street-map_opendata-osm-openstreetmap-activity-7422084150360408064-ews2) to find journalists who might be willing 
to cover OSM and Open Data scraping. From the post:

> Our senior site reliability engineer (...) is seeing unprecedented levels of 
> bots attempting to sc[r]ape OSM data. For comparison, in recent years, he has 
> seen 1 or a few IPs doing 10,000+ requests, but this week we're seeing 
> 100,0000+ IPs in a coordinated [effort?] to scrape, each IP doing a few requests.

This development is (rightly, I think) linked to AI companies gathering data. 
Stadia Maps and other geospatial projects report [similar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7422084150360408064?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7422084150360408064%2C7422149987184226304%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287422149987184226304%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7422084150360408064%29) [observations](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7422084150360408064?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7422084150360408064%2C7422178799154343936%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287422178799154343936%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7422084150360408064%29).

The juxtaposition of "open data" and "scraping" is, of course, jarring: Truly 
open data (such as OSM) does not need be scraped but can be obtained through, 
for example, bulk downloads and APIs, ideally fairly used, thus not unnecessarily 
burdening the projects and their infrastructure.

So far, Guardian, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Lage der Nation, and others have 
responded. Watch your local (tech) news outlet.

Update: This reminded me of loosely related topics discussed by [Stefan Verhuulst](https://thegovlab.org/stefaan-verhulst.html): ["Five asymmetries" around AI and data](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/five-asymmetries-20-questions-reflections-ahead-uns-ai-verhulst-phd-cfulf) and "[Data Commons: The Missing Infrastructure for Public Interest Artificial Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-commons-missing-infrastructure-public-interest-verhulst-phd-k8eec)".

[^osmaccount]: I couldn't find out who controls this account or if the OSM Foundation is behind it. It has many "[employees](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B820543%5D&sid=0O1)" on LinkedIn. I did find the [referenced Mastodon post](https://hachyderm.io/@osm_tech@en.osm.town/115968555044555242) and [another one](https://hachyderm.io/@osm_tech@en.osm.town/115973949166724040) on this topic from the "OpenStreetMap Ops Team" on the "@en.osm.town" instance. And the person referenced in the LinkedIn post is part of the [OSM Operations Working Group](https://operations.osmfoundation.org). So I do think this is legit.
