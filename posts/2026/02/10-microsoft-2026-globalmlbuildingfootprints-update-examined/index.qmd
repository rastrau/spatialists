I think[^4years] since 4 years, Microsoft has been providing a global building 
footprints dataset under the `GlobalMLBuildingFootprints` name. Besides this 
main dataset, there are also [regional datasets for various regions](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints?tab=readme-ov-file#will-there-be-more-data-coming-for-other-geographies).

In a fresh article, Mark Litwintschik takes [a closer look at the 
data](https://tech.marksblogg.com/ms-buildings-2026.html) – something which is 
done too rarely, I think. He visualizes, among others, global building density, the coverage of building heights (focussed on the USA, Europe, and parts of Oceania), and confidence values, and also highlights various types of false positives[^errors]. As an additional benefit, 
[Mark's article](https://tech.marksblogg.com/ms-buildings-2026.html) also 
shows how Microsoft's data can be obtained and explored using DuckDB.

[^4years]: The article I link to here as well as the ["Microsoft Building Footprints" entry](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/ms-buildings) in Microsoft's Planetary Computer both 
indicate 2014 as the starting year. Besides my memory (which may be false), 
looking at the GlobalMLBuildingFootprints repository and its 
[Readme](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction) 
makes me think that while some of the data used dates back to 2014, the first 
computation and release of this data was much later. The 
[OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microsoft_Building_Footprint_Data) 
seems to confirm my hunch.

[^errors]: ... or "errors of commission", "type 1 errors"... – or what term 
your (sub)discipline prefers.
