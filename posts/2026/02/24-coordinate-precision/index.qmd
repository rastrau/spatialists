Besides [identifying the correct CRS][CRS][^CRS] of one's 
(or more often: others') datasets correctly, choosing an appropriate level 
of coordinate precision (for example, when converting to GeoJSON or WKT[^WKT]) 
can present pitfalls in data management.

There's even an [xkcd][xkcd] about it (you know it’s serious when it’s in the 
xkcd canon):

I've recently come across an interactive (maybe a bit less humorous, but more 
practical) introduction to this topic, by Mapbox: "[Understand GeoJSON 
coordinate precision][mapbox-tool]" (direct link to the [full-screen map][map]). 

This tool features an interactive map displaying a grid of regularly spaced points 
representing single-digit increments of coordinate precisions overlaid on New 
York City. As you vary the coordinate precision using a slider, the map 
dynamically updates to show how the points represent a smaller or larger area. 
It’s tricky to describe but instantly intuitive when you see it:

![](coordinate-precision-4.jpg "Coordinate precision 4 (source: Mapbox)")

![Coordinate precision 2, 4, and 6 (from the top). The last map (which cannot be zoomed in further) shows a zebra crossing / crosswalk under the point raster. (source: Mapbox)](coordinate-precision-6.jpg "Coordinate precision 6 (source: Mapbox)")

The [Mapbox tool][mapbox-tool] is a nice way to visualize how coordinate 
precision influences the representation of spatial data. And it can help you 
choose a suitable precision, without unnecessarily bloating your data.
