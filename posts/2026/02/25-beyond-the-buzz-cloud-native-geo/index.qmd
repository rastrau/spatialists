description: "#CloudNativeGeo is everywhere, but does it live up to the hype? Lukas Merz takes a sharp look at formats like #COG, #FlatGeoBuf, #GeoParquet, and #PMTiles, and helps you decide when #cloudnative is the right tool for the job."

From [Lukas Merz][lukasmerz] comes an interesting article[^transp] on the 
paradigm _"du jour"_, cloud-native[^cloud-native] geospatial. The article is titled 
"[Cloud-native geospatial: What it can do, what it can't do – and when you 
really need it][blogpost]". While the article is in German, browser translation 
should work well. From the [text][blogpost]:

> In the world of geodata, "cloud-native" has become a buzzword. At 
conferences, in product brochures, and in LinkedIn posts, it sounds as if the 
future of geoinformation has already been decided (...) It's time to take a 
closer look. This blog post aims to provide an honest assessment. What is 
behind the term? Where are its real strengths? Where are the limitations? And 
when is it simply better to stick with traditional approaches?

In the article, Lukas provides a brief overview of several prominent 
cloud-native formats :

- Cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
- FlatGeoBuf (FGB) 
- GeoParquet and
- PMTiles

The article goes on to explain where #cloudnativegeo excels, where it falls 
short, and when it’s the right choice. 

In my view, this is a balanced, informative, and timely piece that gives 
cloud-native geospatial its due while cleanly cutting through the hype. 
[Recommended reading][blogpost] for anyone interested in the future of 
geospatial data management and dissemination.

[^cloud-native]: I.e., taking full advantage of the cloud computing model; in the data world typically through enabling [partial downloads](https://blog.sogeo.services/blog/2023/12/29/statuscode-206-letsgetstarted.html) of file contents through so-called [HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests)
