# Spatialists, year one

One year ago [today](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/02/04-hello-world/), 
*Spatialists* went live. I had a simple premise: Curate interesting geospatial 
news without the constraints (and lock-in!) of (fleeting[^twitter]) social 
media platforms. *Spatialists* follows the 
[POSSE paradigm](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) which I deem advisable in this era 
of the internet: *Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere*. The tooling 
behind the site is 
[entirely open-source](https://github.com/rastrau/spatialists).[^tooling] 

![POSSE: Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (source: 
[Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE))](posse.jpg "POSSE: Publish (on your) 
Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (source: Indieweb)")

I [didn't give guarantees](http://spatialists.ch/about.html) about frequency or 
quality (still don't[^dayjob]). Spatialists is still an experiment in 
independent, interest-driven content curation. 

# A look back

The idea behind *Spatialists* is very modest: A microblog for geospatial news, not 
the long-form commentary style of (bygone, it seems, at least for now) early 
blogging days. No elaborate and long winding analysis, but a focus on giving 
pointers to interesting developments with brief context and sometimes critical 
reflection.

Since last February, I have published 164 posts[^sequence] covering many 
aspects of the geospatial industry from Swiss cadastral surveying strategies to 
#cloudnativegeo, from PostGIS and AI integration to experimental "vibe 
cartography" and vector tile server performance. The topics range from local 
news about developments in Switzerland to global, from deeply technical (for 
example, GeoParquet 2.0 specifications) to more high-level.

# Some major currents

If I look back, I see several themes throughout the year, each revealing 
something about where our field is heading:

## The cloud-native rising

The #cloudnative trend (think: GeoParquet, Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF, PMTiles), 
that is the ongoing transformation toward cloud-native geospatial formats and 
workflows, captured attention.  Not because the technology is extra-ordinarily 
revolutionary, but because it signals that "geo" is being mainstreamed in the 
broader data engineering world.

![You may have seen this before: My go-to "cloud-native" visual metaphor](tomasz-sroka-eaxgNP4cpY8-unsplash.jpg "You may have seen this before: My go-to "cloud-native" visual metaphor")

Related developments reinforced this shift: STAC^[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog] 
becoming an official OGC^[Open Geospatial Consortium] standard and even legacy 
tools adding, for example, GeoParquet support. A particularly bold claim came 
from Drew Breunig: namely that DuckDB might be [the most important geospatial 
software of the last decade](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/06/17-the-most-important-geospatial-software/index.html).

The underlying message: geospatial is dissolving into the general modern data 
stack (MDS). [Bill Dollins' recent "Post GIS revisited" 
essay](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2026/02/01-gis-dissolution/) published ten 
years after a seminal piece in the same veign also drove this point home, for 
me.

## AI everywhere?

Of course, another important current was AI's increasingly tangible presence 
in geospatial tools and work. (Hopefully) Not the hype-train, but actually 
valuable experimentation or even implementations.

![I decided against both the clichéd robot and a Nano Banana image](shahadat-rahman-voM1Z9cGPCU-unsplash.jpg "I decided against both the clichéd robot and a Nano Banana image")

For example, the [GeoAI report for Switzerland](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/03/25-geoai-state-of-play-in-2025/index.html) by The *Innovation Booster Articificial Intelligence* provided a snapshot 
of how players are integrating AI into GIS applications. Geneva's 
SITG^[Système d’information du territoire à Genève] tested [autonomous GIS 
capabilities](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/04/30-testing-autonomous-gis/index.html). 
And very recently, [Brian Timoney explored how AI can both use PostGIS and be 
used from within PostGIS](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2026/01/23-postgis-ai/) 
and Dan Shapiro proposed [five maturity levels for AI use in software 
development](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2026/01/31-five-levels-of-ai-use/). 
What emerges is a picture of a field trying to integrate a powerful but not yet 
perfected and not yet perfectly understood tool.

## The Swiss ecosystem in motion

For a site with a declared Swiss perspective, the past year also offered a view 
of a national geospatial ecosystem in (further) development. The Swiss 
Geoinformation Strategy (SGS) defined or updated 
[action](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/02/17-sgs-action-plan-2025/index.html) 
[plans](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2026/01/25-just-out-sgs-action-plan-2026/index.html) and 
[reflected on its progress](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/05/12-recording-colloquium-on-the-state-of-sgs-implementation/index.html). The 
[cantons of Basel-Stadt](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/06/24-mapbs-3d-and-launch-event/index.html) and 
[Zug](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/06/03-3d-mode-and-customer-survey-for-zugmap/index.html) launched new 3D geoportals, the canton of Aargau 
[launched a modernized map viewer](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/03/31-new-map-viewer-for-the-canton-of-aargau/index.html). And: The [SWISSGEO](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/06/13-swissgeo-the-swiss-geospatial-platform/index.html) platform progressed from concept to 
[prototype](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/09/01-swissgeo-prototype-online/index.html). 
What made these developments interesting were less the technical aspects, but 
rather watching policy, infrastructure, and community interact. 

Particularly innovative and refreshing initiatives, in my opionion, were 
not-just-geospatial but interdisciplinary – case in point: the [real-time 
Earth observation pipeline for drought monitoring](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/05/09-new-national-drought-platform/index.html) – and not governmental or even institutional but 
effected by driven and skilled individuals – for example:

- [Fabian](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/04/05-serving-vector-tiles-fast/index.html) 
[Rechsteiner](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2026/01/25-vectormap-swiss-vector-maps/index.html) 
(Vector tiles)
- [Stephan](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/02/08-topodiscs-custom-3D-printed-swiss-landscapes/index.html) 
[Heuel](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/02/20-cloud-native-web-app-case-study/index.html) 
(3D printing and cloud-native geo)
- [David](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/10/01-vibing-cartography/index.html) 
[Oesch](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/10/13-vibe-cartography-sandbox/index.html) 
(AI cartography) and 
- [Oliver Wipfli](https://spatialists.ch/posts/2025/09/02-mapterhorn-terrain-tiles/index.html) 
(3D service)

It was exciting to see them build *and share their ideas in public* and to see 
the community respond with interest and support. I hope to see more of this in 
the future, and I hope that *Spatialists* can be a platform to share and 
amplify such work.

![Switzerland: Not an island (duh!)](claudio-schwarz-MNm04LZJ0w4-unsplash.jpg "Switzerland: Not an island (duh!)")

I'm sure, the Swiss story isn't unique. Many regions probably have similar 
dynamics and ask themselves similar questions. At least, that is the belief 
which underpins my hope that Swiss content is met with interest also in other 
regions of the world. While I haven't done any systematic analysis, this seems 
to be correct. 

# Reflecting ...

Some of my impressions and learnings about the past year:

- The microblog format feels more sustainable than a full-fledged blog. My hope
is that the pointers and resources are inspiring to some people, help advance 
the discourse within our field and maybe inspire somebody to build on top of 
them.

- When I draft an article, my script [puts the publication time 15 minutes in 
the future](https://github.com/rastrau/spatialists/blob/7a1c066748fd7ae91dee90f6172b355b625e0867/draft.py#L60). 
On some occasions this worked out. On many^[many!] more occasions though I need 
some or quite some more time than that to write a post. Overall, I gauge that I 
invest maybe 1 to 2 hours per week on average, for choosing a topic, writing, 
summarizing, and finding and formatting images. Of course, I invest more time 
to read up on geospatial news and developments; that is not specific to this 
project, though, but something I have always done as part of my professional 
development.

- It was very nice to see that a few people have approached me with ideas for 
posts, reached out with feedback or recommended *Spatialists* within their 
network. It was also fantastic to see some people sport one of the *Spatialists* 
stickers on their laptops!

- Two people, Stephan Heuel and David Oesch, even [contributed 
posts](http://spatialists.ch/contribute.html) and thus broadened the 
perspective, which was a great pleasure!

- Curating feels good: I get to read about and share interesting developments, 
guided by my (and hopefully the readers') interests, and I get to reflect on 
them. Through this process, thematic coverage is of course idiosyncratic. I 
hope the mix of topics works not just for me.

# ... and asking for your input!

As *Spatialists* enters its second year, I'm interested in your thoughts:

- **What is missing?** – Are there topics or perspectives that should get more 
attention? What's being undercovered?

- **What is particularly useful?** – Does the current format and mix of topics 
work for you? Are there adjacent topics worth covering?

- **What resonates with you?** – Which posts or themes have you found most 
valuable? What made them stand out?

I'm particularly curious about how practitioners use (or would like to use) a 
resource like this. The original premise – independent, interest-driven 
curation – will remain, I think, but within that model, there is room to 
evolve.

# Thank you!

To: 

- everyone who has read, shared, recommended, or discussed Spatialists.ch 
- the occasional contributors who have shared their perspectives
- everybody who has shared feedback, ideas, or encouragement, and 
- the many people creating the work that gets covered here: 

**Thank you so much!**

[^twitter]: For some years, I *was* quite active on Twitter, for example. No more. Besides shifting platform and other politics, there is also the normal [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) cycle, which makes platforms unattractive *as primary or exclusive outlets*, in my opinion.

[^tooling]: While I don't host the site on GitHub for several reasons, that would be entirely possible. Everything (about this tooling! – not, like, in the world 🙂) can be had for free: GitHub account, GitHub actions (free tier), Mastodon account, LinkedIn account, Zapier (free tier). The latter is only for conveniently posting from the RSS feed to LinkedIn. But that could, of course, also be solved differently. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@spatialists.ch) if you'd like to learn more.

[^sequence]: The number of posts per month, from February 2025 to February 2026 is: 15 + 18 + 17 + 17 + 16 + 16 + 4 + 10 + 18 + 9 + 10 + 13 + 1 = 164. That's a bit more than 3 posts per week, approximately 4 per week outside of holidays.

[^dayjob]: I would like to be able to dedicate more time to this endeavour, but I also have a day-job 🙂
