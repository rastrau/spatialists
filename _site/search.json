    "text": "If you create, or are curious about, vector tiles, you may have come across the command line utility Tippecanoe1 (TIP-ə-kə-NOO). It’s probably no secret that its usage is not entirely trivial.\nIn a similar vein to the best practice guide for Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs by GeoStandards.ch, Cameron Kruse has built the Tippecanoe Command Generator. It’s a Streamlit app that takes you through Basic Options, Zoom & Detail, Feature Handling, Attributes and Advanced Options and creates a Tippecanoe command custom-tailored to your requirements. The tool is open-source and free of AI / LLMs.\nCameron Kruse has also published an article titled “The Dark Art of Vector Map Tiling” where he goes into detail about the Tippecanoe Command Generator, gives additional tips and also points to valuable resources such as map tile viewers."

Starting with GDAL 3.11, parts of the GDAL utilities are available from a new single gdal program which accepts commands and subcommands. This simplifies and unifies GDAL syntax. More detail can be found on the gdal manual page.\nThe migration guide includes several examples:\n\nGetting information on a raster dataset in human-readable format: gdalinfo my.tif becomes gdal raster info --format=text my.tif\nGetting information on a vector dataset in human-readable format: ogrinfo -al -so my.gpkg becomes gdal vector info --format=text my.gpkg\nConverting a georeferenced netCDF file to cloud-optimized GeoTIFF: gdal_translate -of COG in.nc out.tif becomes gdal raster convert --of=COG in.nc out.tif\nClipping a raster with a bounding box: gdal_translate -projwin 2 50 3 49 in.tif out.tif becomes gdal raster clip --bbox=2,49,3,50 in.tif out.tif\n\nFor those interested: On June 3, the GDAL Project Steering Committee will host a webinar on the modernization of GDAL:\n\nThe 2024 GDAL User Survey showed the GDAL Command Line Interface (CLI) to be in need of modernization, and GDAL 3.11.0 is the first release to provide a substantial refactoring of the common interaction point of many with the nearly 27 year old software project. (…) Existing GDAL CLIs will continue to be supported as-is, but we hope the new CLI will make it easier to explore, learn, and reason about GDAL while manipulating geospatial data. In celebration of the release, Even Rouault, Dan Baston, Mike Smith, and Howard Butler of the GDAL project will be hosting a webinar to provide a deep dive into the new CLI on June 3rd at 1400 UTC."

The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\n\n(…) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them entirely while the user experience is the same!\n\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO product line (cf. also here for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the “cloud-native geo” paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a GeoStandards.ch-issued whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch, in the digital.ebp.ch blog and of course here, so far."

The interview was published back in December, but if you haven’t read it yet, it is still well worth your time.\nIn the interview, Kyle covers and touches upon, among others:\nThese days, Parquet and GeoParquet are talked about quite often among geospatial professionals. But take note also of GeoArrow. While GeoArrow plays particularly well with GeoParquet, it is not tied to that format and can be used to improve geospatial workflows that involve other formats, too.\nFrom Kyle:\nBe it through GDAL or dozens of other tools such as FME: You may very well have already benefitted from the work around #cloudnativegeo and, in particular, GeoArrow."

    "text": "February marked the 25 year anniversary of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) which gave us the then revolutionary global1 high resolution2 elevation dataset of the same name. What an achievement!\nSRTM travelled on board of Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS3-99 mission in February 2000. Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric C-band SAR4 system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle’s transport bay. During data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth surface.\nInitially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator5. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 1-arcsecond resolution.\nTo celebrate the occasion, there is an interesting look back on SRTM by NASA as well as one by the DLR from which the video below is sourced (in German, but English subtitles are available).\nEnjoy!"

    "text": "Quite a mouthful, that title: “Road network disruptions during extreme flooding events and their impact on the access to emergency medical services: A spatiotemporal vulnerability analysis”. From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

While this guide comes in the form of an ArcGIS storymap, it is software-agnostic.\nScale, transparency-and-opacity, hue, tone, halos, … – this guide covers many different visual variables and how they can be used, on their own or together, to make a map a lot more aesthetic and the information it contains easier to grasp.\nThe labeling guide is part of a six-part1 series in which Andy Skinner looks at his work. The other parts are listed at the bottom of the page."

    "text": "The Federal Palace of Switzerland (Photo by Ansgar Scheffold)\nThe EMBAG1 or LMETA2, a Swiss federal law enacted at the start of 20243, aims to promote digital workflows for federal government processes (“digital first”). To that end, it for example lays out principles to promote e-government at the federal level and for collaborating with other e-government entities. Among other things, the EMBAG/LMETA further mandates that:\nI often encounter the opinion that because of this the EMBAG/LMETA mandates geodata of the federal government to be open data4. However, this is not the case, as I learned about a year ago. But beware: IANAL, that is, I Am Not A Lawyer, as they say.\nThe relevant part of the EMBAG/LMETA is Art. 10 Abs. 2 lit. b or Art. 10 Al. 2 let. b, respectively (below in machine-translation):\nA key term here is “particularly due to”, meaning that what follows is not an exhaustive list. In order to learn more, it’s instructive to check the message of the Federal Council that accompanied the draft for the EMBAG/LMETA: in German / in French.\nWhere the message of the Federal Council discusses Art. 10, we find the following (machine-translation):\nTo conclude, from my layperson’s perspective: The EMBAG/LMETA does not advance OGD for geodata, as previous regulations specific to the geospatial field take precedence."

ThoughtWorks popularized the concept in 2010 with their Technology Radar, a periodic report categorizing technologies into “Adopt”, “Trial”, “Assess”, and “Hold” to guide decision-making.\nThe format has since been adopted by other companies, including Zalando and Spotify, often customized for internal use.\nI recently came across the Geospatial Tech Radar by Element 84. I recommend exploring this one, as it is well-executed from both a content and design/UI perspective.\n\n\n\nGeospatial tech radar by Element 84\n\n\nPS: There is a Swiss variation of a geospatial tech radar called GIS Trends by SOGI (only available in German).

As noted previously regarding the native data types news:\n\nWhat’s going to be even more interesting are the next steps in order to make the cloud-native paradigm work better for spatial data.\n\nCrossing fingers that the GeoParquet support will arrive soon in the Esri software ecosystem and will offer users the full capabilities of the format."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an interesting, albeit definitely non-trivial, remote sensing technology. As an actively sensing technology1 that is independent of both weather and of lighting conditions2. This property makes them a very interesting option for continuous monitoring tasks.\nDepending on the wavelength used, SAR can penetrate vegetation, forests, ice, soil and even some structures and give us information about the conditions beneath. Polarization modes (upon emission and reception of signals) can highlight structural information. Through more advanced concepts such as interferometric SAR or InSAR3, we can measure very small deformations of the Earth’s surface from space, for example in volcanic or earthquake regions.\nEarthByte Lab has compiled a small collection of sources for open SAR data. It features “usual suspects” such as Copernicus, NASA, USGS, but also covers newer and less known options, such as Umbra. The listed use cases are too generic to be very helpful, in my opinion, but the notes on availability and, of course, the access links are a good resource if you want to look into SAR.\nIf you aren’t yet familiar with SAR, you may also appreciate the brief explanatory video below."
