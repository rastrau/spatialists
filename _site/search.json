It aims to combine data into indicators that measure quality of life and support informed decisions. Through art, design, and public exhibitions, the PDL also plans to raise awareness of how indicators connect to social, political, and ethical contexts.\nThe PDL consists of representatives from the four institutions:\nThe University of Zurich participates in the PDL with the Department of Mathematical Modeling and Machine Learning and the Department of Geography. While the initiative is still very young, the PDL website (in German) already lists some flagship and associated projects some of which involve geospatial analysis, for example:\nThe PDL is funded until 2029.\nIf you want to follow along, the PDL has a news feed."

The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\n\n(…) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them entirely while the user experience is the same!\n\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO product line (cf. also here for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the “cloud-native geo” paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a GeoStandards.ch-issued whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch, in the digital.ebp.ch blog and of course here, so far."

Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

Having observed the situation firsthand recently, I decided to explore remote sensing and other data sources to better understand the current conditions and the potential risks of an impending drought. I shared my findings online yesterday, where they garnered significant interest, thus I decided to share them here as well (my apologies if you have seen them before).\nSpecifically, I briefly analyzed Sentinel-2 satellite data (true-color imagery and the Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI) from April 5th, combined with geodata from swisstopo’s swissTLM3D and gauging data to assess the lake’s extent and water levels:\n\n\n\nThe Untersee, captured in Sentinel-2 true-color imagery (source: Copernicus/ESA), is shown here with a red outline indicating the typical shoreline of Lake Constance. While it is common for the water level to drop below the usual shoreline during winter, the extent of this recession is unusually pronounced this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area surrounding Reichenau island is depicted using Sentinel-2 data, analyzed through the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI; source: Copernicus/ESA) to highlight current water conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent and historical water levels at the gauging station in Berlingen. In 2022 (in yellow), the water level was at a similarly low level as today, albeit in summer. (source: FOEN)\n\n\n\n\n\nLakehouse over dry ground along the upper part of Lake Constance as of March 23rd (personal photograph)\n\n\nYou can see more results as well as the ensuing discussion on LinkedIn (if you have a user account) or (with less discussion) on Mastodon (no login required)."

More detail can be found on the gdal manual page.\nThe migration guide includes several examples:\n\nGetting information on a raster dataset in human-readable format: gdalinfo my.tif becomes gdal raster info --format=text my.tif\nGetting information on a vector dataset in human-readable format: ogrinfo -al -so my.gpkg becomes gdal vector info --format=text my.gpkg\nConverting a georeferenced netCDF file to cloud-optimized GeoTIFF: gdal_translate -of COG in.nc out.tif becomes gdal raster convert --of=COG in.nc out.tif\nClipping a raster with a bounding box: gdal_translate -projwin 2 50 3 49 in.tif out.tif becomes gdal raster clip --bbox=2,49,3,50 in.tif out.tif\n\nFor those interested: On June 3, the GDAL Project Steering Committee will host a webinar on the modernization of GDAL:\n\nThe 2024 GDAL User Survey showed the GDAL Command Line Interface (CLI) to be in need of modernization, and GDAL 3.11.0 is the first release to provide a substantial refactoring of the common interaction point of many with the nearly 27 year old software project. (…) Existing GDAL CLIs will continue to be supported as-is, but we hope the new CLI will make it easier to explore, learn, and reason about GDAL while manipulating geospatial data. In celebration of the release, Even Rouault, Dan Baston, Mike Smith, and Howard Butler of the GDAL project will be hosting a webinar to provide a deep dive into the new CLI on June 3rd at 1400 UTC."

They’re too small and require interaction to see countries like Switzerland. At NZZ, we wondered if we could come up with a design that works better.\n\nIn order to rethink thematic world maps, the team has identified the most typical types of maps they use: A) “Glorified Lists” and B) “Spatial Distribution Maps”. They came up with two new solutions:\n\n\n\nThe tested types of maps: “Split continents” and “bubblemap”\n\n\n\nIn a large user study, we showed that our redesigned world map improves readability – especially for small countries. We also found that using bubbles sized according to population, rather than land area, led to interpretations that more accurately reflected the underlying data.\n\nSo both map types performed their function better than the baseline. But despite the improved functionality, the second map type proved not very popular:\n\nStill, many readers commented that the bubble map was hard to read. A few added that it was more informative, but overall, the map remains unpopular. We’ve received similar feedback internally, even when the reasoning behind the design is explained.\n\nA tough, but maybe not uncommon, problem of conveying spatial information."

Such a magically versatile basemap is probably not going to ever exist, but that’s my attempt.\n\nAnd:\n\nOne of the key design rules for avenue is that there are no outrageously fake colors.

In his example, he uses data from STRAVA1 (specifially, the STRAVA global heat map) to improve data in OpenStreet (OSM).\nHe carefully lists some interesting use-cases:\n… as well as a few non-use-cases (or: “gotchas”, as he calls them) for using STRAVA data to improve OSM. In the latter cases a path may be visible in STRAVA, but, for various reasons, should not be mapped in OSM:\nIf you contribute to OSM and want to try using STRAVA data, the OSM Wiki has a setup guide.\nThis reminds me a lot of one of the first professional reports I co-authored on the “Use of crowdsourcing and data mashups” (it was the era of “neogeo” (vs. “paleogeo”), geoweb, web 2.0, etc.). I suspect, to this day, there may very well still be un(der)used potential in crowdsourced data (or whatever you may prefer to call it these days) for geodata creation and maintenance."

In it, he disagrees with more optimistic ideas that AI tools will help novices in a discipline, for example, in software development, to master their fields. He argues that relying on AI assistants undermines actual skill development in beginners, as they are incentivized to use AI-generated solutions over practicing and learning, resulting in shallow engagement with the craft and ultimately producing lower-quality outcomes:\n\nSo his thought is that giving especially younger, less experienced developers “AI” assistants makes sense to get their feet wet, get into contributing to open source but that the quality of the “AI” systems is not there yet to be used by experienced developers who also might have to shoulder a lot more responsibility for the overall quality of a product.

He calls on the community to embrace these (new type of) newcomers, to foster a sense of belonging, and to guide them beyond AI-assisted programming:\n\nI’m not sure where I first heard it, but I like the idea that you are what you do. If you’re painting (even your very first painting) you are a painter. Consequently if you create a program, by hand or with the aid of an agent, you are a programmer. Many people become programmers essentially overnight by picking up one of these tools. Heading to EuroPython this year I worried that the community that shaped me might not be receptive to AI and agentic programming."

(…) When talking about this with people, I often describe it as a perspective. Every problem space looks different depending on where you’re viewing it from. Where you view the problem from is your business’ thesis on that problem.\nThis is, I believe, a solid core of my job, and the LLM is incapable of performing it. It cannot do it for me.

    "text": "From NASA1’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory2 comes fascinating news: In mid-July, NASA researchers demonstrated a new “dynamic targeting” technology that enables a satellite to autonomously “look ahead” along its orbit to determine the optimal direction to aim its sensors for data collection. For example, it can focus on interesting portions of the observable swath or collect data only where clouds do not obscure the view. Notably, this demonstration required no human intervention at any stage.\nFrom the announcement:\nThe demonstration used a briefcase-size cube sat launched in 2024. Since the test satellite lacked a dedicated look-ahead sensor, the spacecraft was periodically tilted forward. Once look-ahead imagery had been captured, onboard edge computing classified the scene and adjusted subsequent data-gathering accordingly. More details are available from a conceference paper.\nInteresting times indeed!"

This was the main reason for the development of the first digital elevation model, RIMINI. The digital elevation model was designed to help position air defense and radar systems. Between 1966 and 1968, 60 soldiers compiled the data required for RIMINI based on the 1:25,000 national map. (source: swisstopo historic)\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital cartography operator using the Scitex system (white-balance adjusted; source: swisstopo historic)\n\n\nThe podcast is now in its fourth season, with the following themes per season:\n\nSeason 1: Water on historic maps\nSeason 2: Human and mechanical computers\nSeason 3: Names on maps\nSeason 4: National boundary\n\nAs far as I have seen, the podcast episodes are in (standard) German, also the one about standard French and Patois."

The authors highlight several compelling reasons why expert generalists are important. For example:\n\nOne of the biggest problems with excessive focus on tools and framework expertise is when it is cemented into organizational structures. Teams and organisations get structured around tool expertise, with hardened boundaries making it difficult for people from one team to acquire skills from others. Beyond language preferences like Python or Java, you can see this crystallise in the three most common software verticals – Application Development, Data Engineering, and DevOps. (…) Once these words harden into career lanes, they solidify the very silos that the Agile and DevOps culture was meant to dismantle.\n\nSome key takeaways from the article include:\n\nWe should recognize “Expert Generalist” as a first-class skill\nExpert Generalists help ensure that complex tasks get done\nTeams should encompass a mix of Expert Generalists and a few key specialists\n\nSet aside about 15 minutes for the article — it’s an interesting read."

It’s hard to imagine an open source software based/open source tech producing geospatial startup receiving significant VC funding in the current economy, let alone multiple startups competing with each other receiving that kind of funding.\nOne hypothesis for the influx of money into open source geospatial in the 2010s is the zero interest rate phenomenon (ZIRP)—basically, low interest rates drove a lot of funds seeking higher yields into venture capital, which meant a lot more money sloshing around, which meant even something as unlikely to have a 10X return on investment as open source basemaps-as-a-service could get a piece of the action.\n\nIt’s a fascinating read, if you are not only interested in geospatial technology, but also in economic and political factors shaping the industry."

If you’d like to dive into the topic a bit, this blog post (in German) by Stefan Kaufmann explains the basic idea using postal addresses as a simple area of application (machine-translated to English, and to French; the title is a bit mangled in both, as the German avoids using an umlaut, but otherwise the translations ought to work okay).\nFrom the article:\n\nBecause, just as with spoken language, we humans are quite good at interpreting ambiguities or imprecise expressions according to their context. We don’t just read what’s written somewhere and interpret it literally; we interpret without having to think too much about what might have been meant . Unfortunately, when we write, we also assume that the other person will already know what is actually meant . And that this other person isn’t a computer that interprets what is written comparatively literally. And then things get wild.\n\nThe article adopts a mostly European perspective and doesn’t even mention other addressing conventions such as the ones used in Japan. If this interests you: A few years back, Ed Freyfogle of OpenCage talked about geocoding on the MapScaping Podcast. And some of the complexity and variety of address data are evident in this collection of address formatting rules by OpenCage."

Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric C-band SAR4 system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle’s transport bay. During data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth surface.\nInitially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator5. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 1-arcsecond resolution.\nTo celebrate the occasion, there is an interesting look back on SRTM by NASA as well as one by the DLR from which the video below is sourced (in German, but English subtitles are available).\nEnjoy!"

As an actively sensing technology1 that is independent of both weather and of lighting conditions2. This property makes them a very interesting option for continuous monitoring tasks.\nDepending on the wavelength used, SAR can penetrate vegetation, forests, ice, soil and even some structures and give us information about the conditions beneath. Polarization modes (upon emission and reception of signals) can highlight structural information. Through more advanced concepts such as interferometric SAR or InSAR3, we can measure very small deformations of the Earth’s surface from space, for example in volcanic or earthquake regions.\nEarthByte Lab has compiled a small collection of sources for open SAR data. It features “usual suspects” such as Copernicus, NASA, USGS, but also covers newer and less known options, such as Umbra. The listed use cases are too generic to be very helpful, in my opinion, but the notes on availability and, of course, the access links are a good resource if you want to look into SAR.\nIf you aren’t yet familiar with SAR, you may also appreciate the brief explanatory video below."

From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

    "text": "This week, outlets such as The Hacker News and The Register reported that a bad actor had gained backdoor access to an ArcGIS Server instance through a compromised Server Object Extension (SOE). This was reportedly possible because the group had managed to gain access to a portal administrator account of the organization being attacked. Importantly, this affected this specific organization, not users of ArcGIS Server in general. The security company ReliaQuest has an in-depth article. It makes the point that this event raises questions for a much broader IT segment than “only” the geospatial industry:\n\nAlthough specialized applications like ArcGIS may escape heavy scrutiny, the weakness exploited exists in any public-facing application an organization considers “safe.” No matter how secure a product is designed to be, a gap is inevitably created by the unique way each customer implements it. Attackers are skilled at operating in this gap. This situation also reveals a common disconnect between the assumption that security best practices are always being followed and the complex realities of real-world environments.\n\nEsri Software Security & Privacy has published an article with clarifications and pointers to resources. It specifies which set of circumstances were necessary for this to occur:\n\nBottomline, this case demonstrates that when a deployment implements numerous layers counter to best practices, a deployment may be compromised.\n\nOn LinkedIn, IT Operations Manager Riccardo Klinger has published an article listing security measures one can take. Given the occasion, the measures are linked to Esri guidance material. But many of the measures generalize well to operating other IT infrastructure assets."

The tool runs in your browser and its premise is simple: Drop a GeoJSON, a Shapefile (zipped or not), a KML, a GPX, a CSV1, a GeoPackage, or a GeoTIFF onto its interface and obtain a cloud-native representation of it – a Cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) if your input was a (standard) GeoTIFF, a GeoParquet2 file, a Flatgeobuf file, or PMTiles in all other cases.\nQuick demo by Pierre Blanchet:\nGeo Cloud Converter is built using GDAL3 and DuckDB WASM4. The latter means that the data never leaves your computer, all processing is done in your browser. Maximum file size is 1 GB.\nNeat, for quick testing or in a pinch."

Tons of websites already have feeds, mostly news sites and blogs.\nWhenever you see a website with a feed, that means you can subscribe to that site using a feedreader app. The feedreader checks the feeds you have subscribed to automatically from time to time. If you subscribe to only one site, you might say “This doesn’t save me much time over occasionally checking that site myself.” But if you end up subscribing to a dozen or more sites, you’ll find that your feedreader becomes the place for news."

Some feedreaders also have built-in methods to try and find a feed, given only the website URL.\nIf you want to follow Spatialists, copy the address of its feed, https://spatialists.ch/index.xml, and add it to the subscriptions in your feedreader app. To achieve this, usually, you paste the address after having pressed a button “Add Feed”, “Add Content”, “Subscribe” or in the search function of the app.\nYou’re done! You can now read the latest Spatialists content in your feedreader!"
