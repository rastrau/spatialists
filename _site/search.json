Structured around 12 common frustrations and questions, it serves as a refreshingly practical problem-solving guide for CRS issues.\nItems include, for example (the actual section headings add the emphatic “I hate coordinate systems!” 😃):\n\nMy dataset is off the coast of Africa! — hint: Null Island\nMy dataset is not located where it should be!\nMy dataset is slightly offset from where it should be!\n\nFor Switzerland, maybe we should add “My dataset seems to be located in eastern Europe / in the Atlantic off the coast of France” and “My dataset has Switzerland in portrait rather than landscape mode”…\nThe site offers another exceptional feature: if your dataset has an incorrect CRS specified, you can enter an approximate latitude and longitude along with the corresponding X and Y coordinates from your dataset, and ihatecoordinatesystems.com will attempt to identify the correct CRS! Needless to say, this functionality can save your day."

From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

As an actively sensing technology1 that is independent of both weather and of lighting conditions2. This property makes them a very interesting option for continuous monitoring tasks.\nDepending on the wavelength used, SAR can penetrate vegetation, forests, ice, soil and even some structures and give us information about the conditions beneath. Polarization modes (upon emission and reception of signals) can highlight structural information. Through more advanced concepts such as interferometric SAR or InSAR3, we can measure very small deformations of the Earth’s surface from space, for example in volcanic or earthquake regions.\nEarthByte Lab has compiled a small collection of sources for open SAR data. It features “usual suspects” such as Copernicus, NASA, USGS, but also covers newer and less known options, such as Umbra. The listed use cases are too generic to be very helpful, in my opinion, but the notes on availability and, of course, the access links are a good resource if you want to look into SAR.\nIf you aren’t yet familiar with SAR, you may also appreciate the brief explanatory video below."

Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

    "text": "From Stephan Heuel comes a very interesting case study that explores the possibilies of web apps based on the “cloud-native geo” paradigm: The “Swiss Rooftop Explorer” project demonstrates a cloud-native approach to accessing and visualizing geospatial data, specifically roof heights of buildings in Switzerland based on swisstopo’s swissBUILDINGS3D dataset.\n\n\n\nStephan Heuel’s Swiss Rooftop Explorer\n\n\nInstead of relying on traditional GIS server architecture and infrastructure , the project leverages GeoParquet, DuckDB, Tippecanoe, PMTiles, and DuckDB-WASM for efficient data processing, storage and delivery. The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\n\n(…) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them entirely while the user experience is the same!\n\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO product line (cf. also here for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the “cloud-native geo” paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a GeoStandards.ch-issued whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch, in the digital.ebp.ch blog and of course here, so far."

Second, it rings a bit hollow to me and evokes the bad aspects of LinkedIn as well as hard- or soft-paywalled Medium and Substack posts1. That said, I like how the rest of the question is phrased: … whose insights you prioritize, whose talks you never miss, and whose writings you always read?\nOf course, the afore-mentioned call suffers from network / bubble effects (who has seen / shared / heeded the LinkedIn call?). As such, many names are from the English-speaking world2 and also traditionally male.\nWith that out of the way: I find the list nevertheless interesting. It definitely features some very inspiring people and I am considering to connect with, or at least follow, some of them (I follow3 some of them already).\nBelow, I researched (hopefully correctly4, it wasn’t always trivial with some of the more common names) the LinkedIn profiles and current job titles and affiliations of those geospatial experts that were submitted at least twice:\nSpontaneously, I would add Brian Timoney, among others.\n* for lack of a better word"

The tool is open-source and free of AI / LLMs.\nCameron Kruse has also published an article titled “The Dark Art of Vector Map Tiling” where he goes into detail about the Tippecanoe Command Generator, gives additional tips and also points to valuable resources such as map tile viewers."

    "text": "February marked the 25 year anniversary of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) which gave us the then revolutionary global1 high resolution2 elevation dataset of the same name. What an achievement!\nSRTM travelled on board of Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS3-99 mission in February 2000. Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric C-band SAR4 system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle’s transport bay. During data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth surface.\nInitially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator5. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 1-arcsecond resolution.\nTo celebrate the occasion, there is an interesting look back on SRTM by NASA as well as one by the DLR from which the video below is sourced (in German, but English subtitles are available).\nEnjoy!"

To that end, it for example lays out principles to promote e-government at the federal level and for collaborating with other e-government entities. Among other things, the EMBAG/LMETA further mandates that:\nI often encounter the opinion that because of this the EMBAG/LMETA mandates geodata of the federal government to be open data4. However, this is not the case, as I learned about a year ago. But beware: IANAL, that is, I Am Not A Lawyer, as they say.\nThe relevant part of the EMBAG/LMETA is Art. 10 Abs. 2 lit. b or Art. 10 Al. 2 let. b, respectively (below in machine-translation):\nA key term here is “particularly due to”, meaning that what follows is not an exhaustive list. In order to learn more, it’s instructive to check the message of the Federal Council that accompanied the draft for the EMBAG/LMETA: in German / in French.\nWhere the message of the Federal Council discusses Art. 10, we find the following (machine-translation):\nTo conclude, from my layperson’s perspective: The EMBAG/LMETA does not advance OGD for geodata, as previous regulations specific to the geospatial field take precedence."
