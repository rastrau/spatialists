It’s one year old, but still a great overview of various formats – Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT), MBTiles, and Protomaps’s PMTiles – and underpinning technologies, complete with tips how to make your own. Great opening, too:\n\nTo understand how revolutionary vector maps were we have to go back in time to the early 2010s. One Direction is raising to international fame and raster maps are at the height of their popularity. Folks creating raster web maps rendering OpenStreetMap data into beautiful 256x256 pixel images. But raster maps come with limitations.\n\n\n\n\nFreely rotating labels – just one of the benefits of vector tiles (source: CC BY-NC-SA [Daniel-J-H](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/daniel-j-h))"

    "text": "February marked the 25 year anniversary of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) which gave us the then revolutionary global1 high resolution2 elevation dataset of the same name. What an achievement!\nSRTM travelled on board of Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS3-99 mission in February 2000. Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric C-band SAR4 system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle’s transport bay. During data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth surface.\nInitially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator5. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 1-arcsecond resolution.\nTo celebrate the occasion, there is an interesting look back on SRTM by NASA as well as one by the DLR from which the video below is sourced (in German, but English subtitles are available).\nEnjoy!"

The goal of Cadence2 Maps is to make OSM data more readily available for analysis. The platform is the product of a Bachelor’s thesis at the University of Applied Sciences Eastern Switzerland (OST).\nCurrently, Cadence Maps offers OSM data on administrative boundaries and POIs3, “compatible with Overture Maps”4 and accessible via a static web interface from S3 object storage. The data can be queried directly using tools such as DuckDB and SQL or Python. The production pipeline and backend of Cadence Maps relies on open-source tooling.\nFuture plans include refining taxonomy and data issues, benchmarking, and turning the prototype into a weekly updated offering.\nThere is a longer introductory article by Stefan Keller with some interesting points also regarding OMF data. An in-depth description of perceived shortcomings of OMF and a comparison of OMF and Cadence Maps data could be interesting."

From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

    "text": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an interesting, albeit definitely non-trivial, remote sensing technology. As an actively sensing technology1 that is independent of both weather and of lighting conditions2. This property makes them a very interesting option for continuous monitoring tasks.\nDepending on the wavelength used, SAR can penetrate vegetation, forests, ice, soil and even some structures and give us information about the conditions beneath. Polarization modes (upon emission and reception of signals) can highlight structural information. Through more advanced concepts such as interferometric SAR or InSAR3, we can measure very small deformations of the Earth’s surface from space, for example in volcanic or earthquake regions.\nEarthByte Lab has compiled a small collection of sources for open SAR data. It features “usual suspects” such as Copernicus, NASA, USGS, but also covers newer and less known options, such as Umbra. The listed use cases are too generic to be very helpful, in my opinion, but the notes on availability and, of course, the access links are a good resource if you want to look into SAR.\nIf you aren’t yet familiar with SAR, you may also appreciate the brief explanatory video below."

I shared my findings online yesterday, where they garnered significant interest, thus I decided to share them here as well (my apologies if you have seen them before).\nSpecifically, I briefly analyzed Sentinel-2 satellite data (true-color imagery and the Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI) from April 5th, combined with geodata from swisstopo’s swissTLM3D and gauging data to assess the lake’s extent and water levels:\n\n\n\nThe Untersee, captured in Sentinel-2 true-color imagery (source: Copernicus/ESA), is shown here with a red outline indicating the typical shoreline of Lake Constance. While it is common for the water level to drop below the usual shoreline during winter, the extent of this recession is unusually pronounced this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area surrounding Reichenau island is depicted using Sentinel-2 data, analyzed through the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI; source: Copernicus/ESA) to highlight current water conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent and historical water levels at the gauging station in Berlingen. In 2022 (in yellow), the water level was at a similarly low level as today, albeit in summer.

The GitHub repo highlights speed comparisons between six vector tile servers across different tests:\nBesides the statistics in the benchmark repository, Fabian Rechsteiner has published an eye-opening interactive side-by-side comparison of the six vector tile servers using a MapLibre client and data from the canton of Thurgau at https://vectormap.ch:\nFabian Rechsteiner’s benchmark repository contains the code to roll your own tests (or maybe update his results a few months down the road).

While Earth observation has always been about detecting change, Cadell argues that the industry still struggles to treat time as a structured and fundamental dimension.\nThe gap: Geospatial tools remain rooted in static, two-dimensional thinking. Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\n\n(…) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them entirely while the user experience is the same!\n\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO product line (cf. also here for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the “cloud-native geo” paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a GeoStandards.ch-issued whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch, in the digital.ebp.ch blog and of course here, so far."

It’s hard to imagine an open source software based/open source tech producing geospatial startup receiving significant VC funding in the current economy, let alone multiple startups competing with each other receiving that kind of funding.\nOne hypothesis for the influx of money into open source geospatial in the 2010s is the zero interest rate phenomenon (ZIRP)—basically, low interest rates drove a lot of funds seeking higher yields into venture capital, which meant a lot more money sloshing around, which meant even something as unlikely to have a 10X return on investment as open source basemaps-as-a-service could get a piece of the action.\n\nIt’s a fascinating read, if you are not only interested in geospatial technology, but also in economic and political factors shaping the industry."

We don’t just read what’s written somewhere and interpret it literally; we interpret without having to think too much about what might have been meant . Unfortunately, when we write, we also assume that the other person will already know what is actually meant . And that this other person isn’t a computer that interprets what is written comparatively literally. And then things get wild.\n\nThe article adopts a mostly European perspective and doesn’t even mention other addressing conventions such as the ones used in Japan. If this interests you: A few years back, Ed Freyfogle of OpenCage talked about geocoding on the MapScaping Podcast. And some of the complexity and variety of address data are evident in this collection of address formatting rules by OpenCage."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In my experience, early career geospatial professionals often, geo-adjacent professionals virtually always, struggle with coordinate reference systems (CRSs). Who can blame them: CRSs can be confusing from a theoretical perspective, and handling them in your day-to-day GIS workflows even more so.\nIn comes ihatecoordinatesystems.com by Dan Mahr: While the naming is very on the nose, this website provides an invaluable service. Structured around 12 common frustrations and questions, it serves as a refreshingly practical problem-solving guide for CRS issues.\nItems include, for example (the actual section headings add the emphatic “I hate coordinate systems!” 😃):\n\nMy dataset is off the coast of Africa! — hint: Null Island\nMy dataset is not located where it should be!\nMy dataset is slightly offset from where it should be!\n\nFor Switzerland, maybe we should add “My dataset seems to be located in eastern Europe / in the Atlantic off the coast of France” and “My dataset has Switzerland in portrait rather than landscape mode”…\nThe site offers another exceptional feature: if your dataset has an incorrect CRS specified, you can enter an approximate latitude and longitude along with the corresponding X and Y coordinates from your dataset, and ihatecoordinatesystems.com will attempt to identify the correct CRS! Needless to say, this functionality can save your day."

The interview was published back in December, but if you haven’t read it yet, it is still well worth your time.\nIn the interview, Kyle covers and touches upon, among others:\nThese days, Parquet and GeoParquet are talked about quite often among geospatial professionals. But take note also of GeoArrow. While GeoArrow plays particularly well with GeoParquet, it is not tied to that format and can be used to improve geospatial workflows that involve other formats, too.\nFrom Kyle:\nBe it through GDAL or dozens of other tools such as FME: You may very well have already benefitted from the work around #cloudnativegeo and, in particular, GeoArrow."

It summarizes important players, innovations, developments over the last four years and future directions of the use of purpose-optimized artificial intelligence1 methods for geospatial tasks2.\nThe report establishes that well-known Swiss GIS providers – EBP3, Esri Switzerland, Geocloud, GeoDataSolutions, GeoWerkstatt, Hexagon, Meteotest and more, unnamed, firms – have made progress integrating AI into GIS applications. Within the start-up- and small-company-space, the report identifies three main avenues in which AI is applied for GIS purposes:\nYou can read the approximately two-page report here."

That said, I like how the rest of the question is phrased: … whose insights you prioritize, whose talks you never miss, and whose writings you always read?\nOf course, the afore-mentioned call suffers from network / bubble effects (who has seen / shared / heeded the LinkedIn call?). As such, many names are from the English-speaking world2 and also traditionally male.\nWith that out of the way: I find the list nevertheless interesting. It definitely features some very inspiring people and I am considering to connect with, or at least follow, some of them (I follow3 some of them already).\nBelow, I researched (hopefully correctly4, it wasn’t always trivial with some of the more common names) the LinkedIn profiles and current job titles and affiliations of those geospatial experts that were submitted at least twice:\nSpontaneously, I would add Brian Timoney, among others.\n* for lack of a better word"
