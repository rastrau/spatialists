While Earth observation has always been about detecting change, Cadell argues that the industry still struggles to treat time as a structured and fundamental dimension.\nThe gap: Geospatial tools remain rooted in static, two-dimensional thinking. Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

The GitHub repo highlights speed comparisons between six vector tile servers across different tests:\nBesides the statistics in the benchmark repository, Fabian Rechsteiner has published an eye-opening interactive side-by-side comparison of the six vector tile servers using a MapLibre client and data from the canton of Thurgau at https://vectormap.ch:\nFabian Rechsteiner’s benchmark repository contains the code to roll your own tests (or maybe update his results a few months down the road). These insights are the results of his Master’s thesis at the University of Salzburg, which is also publicly available (pdf, in German). If you have a subscription, you can also read a shorter article on the analysis in Geomatik Schweiz, edition 11-12/2024 (paywalled, in German).\nObviously, speed isn’t the only quality dimension to decide on a vector tile server.

    "text": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an interesting, albeit definitely non-trivial, remote sensing technology. As an actively sensing technology1 that is independent of both weather and of lighting conditions2. This property makes them a very interesting option for continuous monitoring tasks.\nDepending on the wavelength used, SAR can penetrate vegetation, forests, ice, soil and even some structures and give us information about the conditions beneath. Polarization modes (upon emission and reception of signals) can highlight structural information. Through more advanced concepts such as interferometric SAR or InSAR3, we can measure very small deformations of the Earth’s surface from space, for example in volcanic or earthquake regions.\nEarthByte Lab has compiled a small collection of sources for open SAR data. It features “usual suspects” such as Copernicus, NASA, USGS, but also covers newer and less known options, such as Umbra. The listed use cases are too generic to be very helpful, in my opinion, but the notes on availability and, of course, the access links are a good resource if you want to look into SAR.\nIf you aren’t yet familiar with SAR, you may also appreciate the brief explanatory video below."

From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric C-band SAR4 system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle’s transport bay. During data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth surface.\nInitially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator5. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 1-arcsecond resolution.\nTo celebrate the occasion, there is an interesting look back on SRTM by NASA as well as one by the DLR from which the video below is sourced (in German, but English subtitles are available).\nEnjoy!"

While it is common for the water level to drop below the usual shoreline during winter, the extent of this recession is unusually pronounced this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area surrounding Reichenau island is depicted using Sentinel-2 data, analyzed through the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI; source: Copernicus/ESA) to highlight current water conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent and historical water levels at the gauging station in Berlingen.

The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\n\n(…) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them entirely while the user experience is the same!\n\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO product line (cf. also here for some more background).

    "text": "Relative elevation model (REM) of Neches River (source: OpenTopography (fair use))\nArt with scientific merit: Cartographer Dan Coe has popularized this type of visualization of elevations along rivers and floodplains that have the overall trend in river elevation removed. This technique leaves behind elevation fluctuations more or less relative to the river. Once the elevations in this “relative elevation model” (REM) are rendered, the data exposes – even shallow – current and historical fluvial geomorphology.\nOpenTopography offers RiverREM, a Python-based tool for generating and visualizing REMs automatically. The tool requires only a digital elevation model (DEM) and, optionally, a river centerline1 to run."

    "text": "Few weeks ago, Brian Monheiser has issued a call on LinkedIn:\nAnd the results are in.\nBut first: Personally, I strongly dislike the term “thought leaders.” For one, I don’t like my thoughts to be led all that much. Second, it rings a bit hollow to me and evokes the bad aspects of LinkedIn as well as hard- or soft-paywalled Medium and Substack posts1. That said, I like how the rest of the question is phrased: … whose insights you prioritize, whose talks you never miss, and whose writings you always read?\nOf course, the afore-mentioned call suffers from network / bubble effects (who has seen / shared / heeded the LinkedIn call?). As such, many names are from the English-speaking world2 and also traditionally male.\nWith that out of the way: I find the list nevertheless interesting. It definitely features some very inspiring people and I am considering to connect with, or at least follow, some of them (I follow3 some of them already).\nBelow, I researched (hopefully correctly4, it wasn’t always trivial with some of the more common names) the LinkedIn profiles and current job titles and affiliations of those geospatial experts that were submitted at least twice:\nSpontaneously, I would add Brian Timoney, among others.\n* for lack of a better word"

    "text": "ASIT has published an open data guide for geodata. It’s freely available with their other open-data-themed resources.\nI like this practical guide, more than earlier attempts to approach the topic from a geodata perspective. This new guide is very nicely designed, easy to read, and motivating to data owners. I think it strikes a very nice balance with respect to covering the topic in enough depth to be valuable, while not being trivial and also not covering every tiny detail so that it becomes tiring or boring.\nThe guide:\nAs added bonuses, it for example briefly covers private initivates for opening data, usage conditions (versus licenses), the list of base geodata as a starting point for an open data catalog, and open data formats1.\nOne of the key takeaways (translated):\nWhat’s not to like. Recommended reading."
