    "text": "“Change is the EO1 product: The problem is that we so rarely sell it.”\nA bold statement from Will Cadell in his recent article Time for a Change. While Earth observation has always been about detecting change, Cadell argues that the industry still struggles to treat time as a structured and fundamental dimension.\nThe gap: Geospatial tools remain rooted in static, two-dimensional thinking. Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

    "text": "Quite a mouthful, that title: “Road network disruptions during extreme flooding events and their impact on the access to emergency medical services: A spatiotemporal vulnerability analysis”. From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO1 product line (cf. also here for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the “cloud-native geo” paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a GeoStandards.ch-issued whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch, in the digital.ebp.ch blog and of course here, so far."
