    "text": "This week, outlets such as The Hacker News and The Register reported that a bad actor had gained backdoor access to an ArcGIS Server instance through a compromised Server Object Extension (SOE). This was reportedly possible because the group had managed to gain access to a portal administrator account of the organization being attacked. Importantly, this affected this specific organization, not users of ArcGIS Server in general. The security company ReliaQuest has an in-depth article. It makes the point that this event raises questions for a much broader IT segment than “only” the geospatial industry:\n\nAlthough specialized applications like ArcGIS may escape heavy scrutiny, the weakness exploited exists in any public-facing application an organization considers “safe.” No matter how secure a product is designed to be, a gap is inevitably created by the unique way each customer implements it. Attackers are skilled at operating in this gap. This situation also reveals a common disconnect between the assumption that security best practices are always being followed and the complex realities of real-world environments.\n\nEsri Software Security & Privacy has published an article with clarifications and pointers to resources. It specifies which set of circumstances were necessary for this to occur:\n\nBottomline, this case demonstrates that when a deployment implements numerous layers counter to best practices, a deployment may be compromised.\n\nOn LinkedIn, IT Operations Manager Riccardo Klinger has published an article listing security measures one can take. Given the occasion, the measures are linked to Esri guidance material. But many of the measures generalize well to operating other IT infrastructure assets."

From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

As an actively sensing technology1 that is independent of both weather and of lighting conditions2. This property makes them a very interesting option for continuous monitoring tasks.\nDepending on the wavelength used, SAR can penetrate vegetation, forests, ice, soil and even some structures and give us information about the conditions beneath. Polarization modes (upon emission and reception of signals) can highlight structural information. Through more advanced concepts such as interferometric SAR or InSAR3, we can measure very small deformations of the Earth’s surface from space, for example in volcanic or earthquake regions.\nEarthByte Lab has compiled a small collection of sources for open SAR data. It features “usual suspects” such as Copernicus, NASA, USGS, but also covers newer and less known options, such as Umbra. The listed use cases are too generic to be very helpful, in my opinion, but the notes on availability and, of course, the access links are a good resource if you want to look into SAR.\nIf you aren’t yet familiar with SAR, you may also appreciate the brief explanatory video below."

Technically, it was a single-pass interferometric C-band SAR4 system with the second antenna placed on a roughly 60 meter long mast that had to be deployed from the Shuttle’s transport bay. During data capture in an orbit 233 km above the Earth, the crew had to change data recording tapes every 30 minutes. More than 200 hours of data collection was done through 11 days of flight resulting in more than 12 terabytes of data on the shape of the Earth surface.\nInitially, SRTM digital elevation models were offered at 1-arcsecond resolution over the USA and at 3-arcsecond resolution in the rest of the world. I still remember from working with SRTM data that these resolutions equate to approximately 30 meters and 90 meters, respectively, at the equator5. Today improved, e.g. void-filled, SRTM data is available globally at 1-arcsecond resolution.\nTo celebrate the occasion, there is an interesting look back on SRTM by NASA as well as one by the DLR from which the video below is sourced (in German, but English subtitles are available).\nEnjoy!"

Structured around 12 common frustrations and questions, it serves as a refreshingly practical problem-solving guide for CRS issues.\nItems include, for example (the actual section headings add the emphatic “I hate coordinate systems!” 😃):\n\nMy dataset is off the coast of Africa! — hint: Null Island\nMy dataset is not located where it should be!\nMy dataset is slightly offset from where it should be!\n\nFor Switzerland, maybe we should add “My dataset seems to be located in eastern Europe / in the Atlantic off the coast of France” and “My dataset has Switzerland in portrait rather than landscape mode”…\nThe site offers another exceptional feature: if your dataset has an incorrect CRS specified, you can enter an approximate latitude and longitude along with the corresponding X and Y coordinates from your dataset, and ihatecoordinatesystems.com will attempt to identify the correct CRS! Needless to say, this functionality can save your day."

We don’t just read what’s written somewhere and interpret it literally; we interpret without having to think too much about what might have been meant . Unfortunately, when we write, we also assume that the other person will already know what is actually meant . And that this other person isn’t a computer that interprets what is written comparatively literally. And then things get wild.\n\nThe article adopts a mostly European perspective and doesn’t even mention other addressing conventions such as the ones used in Japan. If this interests you: A few years back, Ed Freyfogle of OpenCage talked about geocoding on the MapScaping Podcast. And some of the complexity and variety of address data are evident in this collection of address formatting rules by OpenCage."

The “traditional” approach involves using your preferred browser’s developer tools to inspect the resources requested through network traffic.\nWith a new extension this task becomes a lot easier: When the Chromium-based Geo Hound extension is enabled, it automatically detects geoservices (and geospatial files such as KML/KMZ, GeoJSON, Shapefiles, and GeoTIFFs) on any webpage you visit. It then collects these in a convenient list for later use:\nA quick test shows that the extension works on, for example, map.geo.bs.ch, geo.so.ch/map, maps.zh.ch, geo.zh.ch/maps, zugmap.ch, and map.geo.admin.ch, not, however, on map.geo.tg.ch."

Notes on political economy of geospatial tech in the early 21st century” explores the forces driving the rapid growth of the geospatial sector in the 2010s:\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about the conditions that set the stage for the period in which geospatial technologies for web and native apps blossomed in the 2010s. It’s hard to imagine an open source software based/open source tech producing geospatial startup receiving significant VC funding in the current economy, let alone multiple startups competing with each other receiving that kind of funding.\nOne hypothesis for the influx of money into open source geospatial in the 2010s is the zero interest rate phenomenon (ZIRP)—basically, low interest rates drove a lot of funds seeking higher yields into venture capital, which meant a lot more money sloshing around, which meant even something as unlikely to have a 10X return on investment as open source basemaps-as-a-service could get a piece of the action.\n\nIt’s a fascinating read, if you are not only interested in geospatial technology, but also in economic and political factors shaping the industry."

The authors highlight several compelling reasons why expert generalists are important. For example:\n\nOne of the biggest problems with excessive focus on tools and framework expertise is when it is cemented into organizational structures. Teams and organisations get structured around tool expertise, with hardened boundaries making it difficult for people from one team to acquire skills from others. Beyond language preferences like Python or Java, you can see this crystallise in the three most common software verticals – Application Development, Data Engineering, and DevOps. (…) Once these words harden into career lanes, they solidify the very silos that the Agile and DevOps culture was meant to dismantle.\n\nSome key takeaways from the article include:\n\nWe should recognize “Expert Generalist” as a first-class skill\nExpert Generalists help ensure that complex tasks get done\nTeams should encompass a mix of Expert Generalists and a few key specialists\n\nSet aside about 15 minutes for the article — it’s an interesting read."

For example, it can focus on interesting portions of the observable swath or collect data only where clouds do not obscure the view. Notably, this demonstration required no human intervention at any stage.\nFrom the announcement:\nThe demonstration used a briefcase-size cube sat launched in 2024. Since the test satellite lacked a dedicated look-ahead sensor, the spacecraft was periodically tilted forward. Once look-ahead imagery had been captured, onboard edge computing classified the scene and adjusted subsequent data-gathering accordingly. More details are available from a conceference paper.\nInteresting times indeed!"

If you’re painting (even your very first painting) you are a painter. Consequently if you create a program, by hand or with the aid of an agent, you are a programmer. Many people become programmers essentially overnight by picking up one of these tools. Heading to EuroPython this year I worried that the community that shaped me might not be receptive to AI and agentic programming."

He worries that reliance on AI tools may devalue genuine skill and create a bleak professional future for developers centered on managing and checking AI output:\n\nThe core of programming, to me, is to develop a theory of the system. (…) When talking about this with people, I often describe it as a perspective. Every problem space looks different depending on where you’re viewing it from. Where you view the problem from is your business’ thesis on that problem.\nThis is, I believe, a solid core of my job, and the LLM is incapable of performing it. It cannot do it for me. It cannot help me do it. There is no shortcut here, I cannot use the forklift to lift the weights for me at the gym.\n\nThree very interesting yet differing and incompatible viewpoints."

From the creator, Jonathan Lurie:\n\nThe main idea behind avenue is to be a one-size-fits-all, a basemap that one can pull whenever they need a basemap, and it’s magically going to work just fine. Such a magically versatile basemap is probably not going to ever exist, but that’s my attempt.\n\nAnd:\n\nOne of the key design rules for avenue is that there are no outrageously fake colors. Highways are not yellow, and the most rule-bending symbology is cycling lanes to be dashed+green and tunnels/bridges to be white.\n\n\n\n\nThe Basemapkit avenue style (source: Jonathan Lurie)\n\n\nMost recently, Jonathan has added relief shading to Basemapkit. Basemapkit offers to options: Mapterhorn (previously covered here) and Mapzen.\n\n\n\nThe Basemapkit avenue style without and with relief shading (source: Jonathan Lurie)\n\n\nThrough color manipulation, the avenue base style is branched out into currently 9 different presets that come with Basemapkit. Users can also modify avenue for their individual use case themselves.\nThere is a GitHub repository as well as two articles by Jonathan detailling the design and the technical background: “Basemapkit: web basemaps for the people” and “Basemapkit: Let’s explore the mountains!”."

They’re too small and require interaction to see countries like Switzerland. At NZZ, we wondered if we could come up with a design that works better.\n\nIn order to rethink thematic world maps, the team has identified the most typical types of maps they use: A) “Glorified Lists” and B) “Spatial Distribution Maps”. They came up with two new solutions:\n\n\n\nThe tested types of maps: “Split continents” and “bubblemap”\n\n\n\nIn a large user study, we showed that our redesigned world map improves readability – especially for small countries. We also found that using bubbles sized according to population, rather than land area, led to interpretations that more accurately reflected the underlying data.\n\nSo both map types performed their function better than the baseline. But despite the improved functionality, the second map type proved not very popular:\n\nStill, many readers commented that the bubble map was hard to read. A few added that it was more informative, but overall, the map remains unpopular. We’ve received similar feedback internally, even when the reasoning behind the design is explained.\n\nA tough, but maybe not uncommon, problem of conveying spatial information."

(…) Existing GDAL CLIs will continue to be supported as-is, but we hope the new CLI will make it easier to explore, learn, and reason about GDAL while manipulating geospatial data. In celebration of the release, Even Rouault, Dan Baston, Mike Smith, and Howard Butler of the GDAL project will be hosting a webinar to provide a deep dive into the new CLI on June 3rd at 1400 UTC."

Two spot examples are that (1) software that reads traditional GIS formats is not particularly good at splitting the work up so that all the cores on your computer are put to good use and (2) most formats are not particularly good at being plonked onto a web server and have sections of them selectively queried (which can often save data producers from standing up a 24/7 web service).”↩︎"

In order to find geo-related OSS, look for “Federal Office of Topography”, the Swiss NMA4 better known as “swisstopo”. Currently, this search only yields the “STAC API” of swisstopo. Perusing the OSS catalog, I additionally found “KADAS Albireo”, a QGIS-based mapping application for the Swiss Armed Forces.\nA start towards digital sovereignty. Hopefully, the list grows longer."

    "text": "There is a quiet shift underway in how we should understand data in general: Jed Sundwall’s1 Great Data Products blog post captures what many practitioners sense but rarely articulate: That definition is as crucial as access. Making data open is not enough. Making it usable is the real act of design. And we can even take this even further:\nJed’s essay urges us to move from abstract notions of “data value” toward a vocabulary of products: intentional, documented, maintained, and situated within real contexts of use2. This is not a semantic adjustment but a philosophical one. It places responsibility back on the makers: Who owns the data? Who is it for? How does it endure?\nIn practice, the implications are profound. We speak often about “extracting value” from data, but value is not something mined; it is something crafted. It emerges when design meets purpose, when usability becomes the interface between complexity and comprehension.\nThis perspective feels especially relevant for open data. An open license is an invitation, not a guarantee.3 Without thoughtful product design and sustained dialogue with users, openness risks becoming ornamental, a gesture rather than a utility.\nThe message as I understand it, distilled: Stop treating data as an inert asset. Treat it as a designed product. Focus on users and on delivery. The value will follow."

Time sliders and animated GIFs are useful, but they fall short of truly integrating time into analysis.\nHow to tackle this? – Future geospatial platforms must embrace 3D and 4D visualization, even if that means losing traditional geographical representation – because understanding change matters more than simply mapping it. Cadell again:\nThis shift in perspective is crucial. Whether for climate monitoring, disaster response, or financial markets, geospatial intelligence isn’t just about where things are – it’s about how and why they change.\nPerhaps it’s time to stop selling static maps and start delivering dynamic, time-driven insights – think dashboards2"

The toolchain is entirely open and in his blog post, Stephan Heuel compares the cloud-native approach to that of a more traditional GIS tech stack:\n\n(…) I truly believe that there is something big behind all of this: The current (classic) web map architecture includes a publication database and a heavy and costly API layer. Just imagine you can get rid of both of them entirely while the user experience is the same!\n\nThe source for learning more about the “cloud-native geo” paradigm is of course the Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum.\nIn the Swiss geospatial industry, data is distributed in cloud-native formats e.g. under the swissEO product line (cf. also here for some more background). To my knowledge, in Switzerland the “cloud-native geo” paradigm has (only, I think (?)) been covered in a GeoStandards.ch-issued whitepaper by OPENGIS.ch, in the digital.ebp.ch blog and of course here, so far."

The authors for example elaborate on the distinction of “night mode” (low contrast dark maps) and “daytime dark mode” (high contrast dark maps), treating them as subgenres within the category of dark-mode maps. The post illustrates the design principles and thinking that went into them using several examples of map styles from Stamen’s portfolio and others. Finally, the authors introduce an interesting scatterplot technique to analyse map color palettes by plotting pixel counts based on their hue and lightness values. These scatterplots can distinguish “shifting” vs. “mirroring” approaches to creating dark-mode maps."
